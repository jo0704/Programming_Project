My lord I require you that I may have so comfortable letters from the king my brother and from you for I throw there was never woman that had more need

Heartily praying you and trusting that you will do it with effect and to rescribe unto me your good will done therein

Albeit as well for the ordering of matters between us and France as for the assurance of the Kingâ€™s pension with other things that I shall reasonably lay in the way I did not so to entreat the articles of this new treaty that the time of doing any thing this year shall be well passed or any conclusion may be taken therein in the same 
I trust the faction of them shall please the Kingâ€™s Highness 
I beseech you of your goodness for your accustomed goodness to continue until such time that I may once tread under foot this horrible monster poverty which hitherto has been so homely with me that she has made me ashamed of my self and many a hundred times to forbear to do my duty to you by cause I was loath to cum to your house with empty hands 
At Chelsey Anno 1533 March 
But she says she trusts this term to be dispatched 
Of all my dealinge with the Nun whether any other man may peradventure put any doubt or move any scruple of any other meaning than I had that can I neither tell nor lies in my hand to let but unto my self it is not possible any part of my demeanour to seem evil And this the clearness of my conscience testifying that in that matter my mind intent and proceeding was lawful and good 
Whereupon I went out with him into the gallery where his mastership sat with master Attorney * master Solicitor and diverse others 
And he added that the King was a Prince not of rigour but of mercy and pity and though he had found obstinacy in any of his Subjects at some time yet if they submitted themselves his Grace would show mercy 
And if this be not enough to keep me alive in good faith I desire not to live 
When it shall be your pleasure to repair hither you must take some pay to come early in the morning that you may be gone again by seven o'clock and so I suppose you may come without suspect 
And now Sir to the intent that you may somewhat perceive such poor qualities as be in me and so thereupon with your benevolent mind you may set forward somewhat better my purpose I shall bravely show unto you the order process and end of all my studies 
Sir I was but late by the singular gentleness of Master Secretary whose goodness both toward me and also to you is so sunk in to my breast that during my life I shall ever reckon my self next to our prince above all other most faithfully to him bound for in the court to the Kingâ€™s service and by his most loving recommendations so graciously of his Highness accepted and admitted that shortly after it pleased the same to call me to his presence and there of you of your studies and of your sentence and opinion in his grace's most weighty causes here late defined most lovingly many things to demand to the which I made such answer as ever I have judged convenient to be made before the majesty of a prince that is such things as I know manifest and true plainly to affirm and such whereof I stand In doubt by conjecture only to rehearse and so your mind heart and desire to do his grace true and faithful service which I know no other wise than I know mine own I boldly did affirm but as touching your opinion in his graceâ€™s late defined causes one of the matrimony the other concerning the authority of the pope for as much as you ever have used this prudent silence never to disclose your sentence and mind but in time and place I could not of your opinion any thing therein plainly affirm but yet this to his Highness I said and surely I thought that as far as your learning and judgement which I esteemed by time and diligent study somewhat was altered and increased also touching the discerning between Godâ€™s law and manâ€™s would stretch and extend all your power and all such knowledge and learning as by the goodness of God and his graceâ€™s liberality you had obtained and got to the maintaining of such things as his graceâ€™s wisdom by court of parliament therein had decreed you would gladly confer to the honour of his Highness and wealth of his realm 
For of this doubt you nothing that albeit upon many reasonable and just causes our most noble prince has withdrawn himself from the pope's authority yet from the certain and sure grounds of scripture his grace in no point is slid no nor yet from the laws nor ceremonies of the church the which yet stand in full strength and authority and so they shall boldly I dare affirm until such time that to his Highness and to his most wise conseil it shall appear expedient them to abrogate and other to substitute by common assent more agreeable to this time and to the nature of our men and also to our whole country more convenient 
In this and the rest also though the Kingâ€™s pleasure be you should give place to no manâ€™s persuasion nor authority as I am sure you will not yet for the love that I bear unto you and for the desire that I have that you should see the judged truth I will note certain places of weight after mine opinion in these things to be considered ever leaving your own judgement free 
In the acts of the apostles you shall find no such thing and after the apostlesâ€™ days the 4 patriarchs of Jerusalem of Antioch of Constantinople of Rome had among them no superiority

My poor opinion is that the Duke of Parma should be vigilantly looked upon for these 20 days although the army of Spain return not this way for of them I have no great doubt although there be great cause for us all to watch carefully and defend mightily those many and proud enemies which seek to supplant the most honourable crown of England from our most gracious Sovereign whom God defend as he has most graciously done for his great mercy's sake
