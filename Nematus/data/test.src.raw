Right Honourable The uncertainty of the reports which daily come unto us out of Calais Dunkirk Ostend Flushing from my Lord of Huntingdon Scotland and such ships and pinnaces which have been sent out for discovery by my Lord Admiral make me rather to rest upon mine own conjecture than upon any of them they disagreeing so much as they do the one affirming that the Duke of Sidonia with his fleet is coming back again that the Duke of Parma is marching presently to embark to be conducted by him the other affirming that it is for certain that the fleet of Spain is past without Scotland for their way homewards 
My poor opinion is that the Duke of Parma should be vigilantly looked upon for these 20 days although the army of Spain return not this way for of them I have no great doubt although there be great cause for us all to watch carefully and defend mightily those many and proud enemies which seek to supplant the most honourable crown of England from our most gracious Sovereign whom God defend as he hath most graciously done for his great mercy's sake
