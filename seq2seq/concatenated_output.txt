To
the
most
noble
and
worthiest
Lords
most
rightful
and
wisest
council
to
our
liege
Lord
the
King
complain
if
it
likes
to
you
the
folk
of
the
Mercery
of
London
as
a
member
of
the
same
city
of
many
wrongs
subtles
and
also
open
oppressions
done
to
them
by
long
time
here
before
passed

Of
which
one
was
where
the
election
of
Mayoralty
is
to
be
to
the
free
men
of
the
City
by
good
and
peaceable
advise
of
the
wisest
and
truest
at
one
day
in
the
year
freely
there
notwithstanding
the
same
freedom
or
franchise
Nichol
Brembre
with
his
upbearers
purposed
him
the
year
next
after
John
Northampton
Mayor
of
the
same
city
with
strong
hand
as
it
is
full
known
and
through
debate
and
stronger
party
against
the
peace
before
purveyed
was
chosen
Mayor
in
destruction
of
many
right

For
in
the
same
year
the
foresaid
Nichol
without
need
aye
in
the
peace
made
diverse
inarmings
by
day
and
eke
by
night
and
destroyed
the
king's
true
lieges
some
with
open
slaughter
some
by
false
imprisonment
and
some
fled
the
city
for
fear
as
it
is
openly
known

And
so
furthermore
for
to
sustain
these
wrongs
and
many
other
the
next
year
after
the
same
Nichol
against
the
foresaid
freedom
and
true
communes
did
cry
openly
that
no
man
should
come
to
choose
their
mayor
but
such
as
were
*assembled
and
though
that
were
*assembled
were
of
his
ordinance
and
after
his
advice

And
in
the
night
next
after
following
he
did
carry
great
quantity
of
armour
to
the
Guildhall
with
which
as
well
strangers
of
the
country
as
others
of
within
were
armed
on
the
morning
against
his
own
proclamation
that
was
such
that
no
man
should
be
armed
and
certain
ambushments
were
laid
that
when
free
men
of
the
city
came
to
choose
their
mayor
broke
up
armed
crying
with
loud
voice
'sle

sle!'
following
him
wherethrough
the
people
for
fear
fled
to
houses
and
other
hidings
as
in
land
of
war
adread
to
be
dead
in
commune

And
thus
yet
hitherward
has
the
Mayoralty
been
held
as
it
were
of
conquest
or
mastery
and
many
other
offices
also

So
that
what
man
privé
or
apart
in
special
that
he
might
wit
grouching
complained
or
held
against
any
of
his
wrongs
or
by
putting
forth
of
whom
so
it
were
were
it
never
so
unprovable
were
appeached
and
it
were
displeasing
to
him
Nichol
anon
was
imprisoned

And
if
in
general
his
falseness
were
againsaid
as
of
us
together
of
the
Mercery
or
other
crafts
or
any
council
would
have
taken
to
againstand
it
or
as
time
out
of
mind
has
been
used
would
accompany
together
how
lawful
so
it
were
for
our
need
or
profit
were
anon
impeached
for
risers
against
the
peace
and
falsely
many
of
us
that
yet
stood
indicted

And
we
been
openly
dis-sclaundered
held
untrue
and
traitors
to
our
King
for
the
same
Nichol
said
before
Mayor
aldermen
and
our
craft
before
him
gathered
in
place
of
record
that
20
or
30
of
us
were
worthy
to
be
drawn
and
hanged
the
which
thing
like
to
your
worthy
Lordship
by
an
even
judge
to
be
proved
or
disproved
the
whether
that
truth
may
show
for
truth
among
us
to
few
or
else
no
man
many
day
dorst
be
shown

And
not
only
unshown
or
hidden
it
has
been
by
man
now
but
also
of
before
time
the
most
profitable
points
of
true
governance
of
the
city
compiled
together
by
long
labour
of
discrete
and
wise
men
without
counsel
of
true
men
for
they
should
not
be
known
ne
continued
in
the
time
of
Nichol
Exton
Mayor
outerliche
were
brent

And
so
far-forth
falsehood
has
been
used
that
of
time
he
Nichol
Brembre
said
in
sustenance
of
his
falsehood
our
liege
lord's
will
was
such
that
never
was
such
as
we
suppose

He
said
also
when
he
had
de-sclaundred
us
which
of
us
would
yield
him
false
to
his
king
the
king
should
do
him
grace
cherish
him
and
be
good
lord
to
him

And
if
any
of
us
all
that
with
God's
help
have
and
shall
be
found
true
was
so
hardy
to
proffer
proving
of
him
self
true
anon
was
commanded
to
prison
as
well
by
the
Mayor
that
now
is
as
of
him
Nichol
Brembre
before

Also
we
have
been
commanded
oft
time
up
our
liegeance
to
unneedful
and
unleeful
diverse
doings

And
also
to
withdraw
us
by
the
same
commandment
from
things
needful
and
leeful
as
was
shown
when
a
company
of
good
women
their
men
dorst
not
travel
barefoot
to
our
liege
lord
to
search
grace
of
him
for
true
men
as
they
supposed
for
then
were
such
proclamations
made
that
no
man
ne
woman
should
approach
our
liege
lord
for
searching
of
grace
and
over-many
other
commandments
also
before
and
since
by
suggestion
and
information
of
such
that
would
not
her
falseness
had
been
known
to
our
liege
lord

And
else
as
among
us
we
can
not
wit
in
what
manner
without
a
much
greater
disease
since
the
governance
of
this
city
stands
as
it
is
before
said
and
will
stand
while
vittaillers
by
suffrance
presume
thilke
states
upon
him
the
which
governance
of
before
this
time
to
much
folk
hidden
shows
him
self
now
open
whether
it
has
been
a
cause
or
beginning
of
division
in
the
city
and
after
in
the
realm
or
not

Wherefore
for
greatest
need
as
to
you
most
worthy
most
rightful
and
wisest
lords
and
council
to
our
liege
lord
the
king
we
beseech
meekly
of
your
grace
correction
of
all
the
wrongs
before
said
and
that
it
like
to
your
lordship
to
be
gracious
men
to
our
liege
lord
the
king
that
such
wrongs
be
known
to
him
and
that
we
may
show
us
and
since
been
held
such
true
men
to
him
as
we
been
and
owe
to
be

Also
we
beseech
unto
your
gracious
lordship
that
if
any
of
us
in
special
or
general
be
impeached
to
our
liege
lord
or
to
his
worthy
counsel
by
communing
with
others
or
approching
to
our
king
as
with
Brembre
or
his
abettors
with
any
wrong
witness
bearing
as
that
it
stands
otherwise
amongst
us
here
than
as
it
is
now
proved
it
has
stood
or
any
other
wrong
suggestion
by
which
our
liege
lord
has
been
unleeffullich
informed
that
then
your
worshipful
lordship
be
such
that
we
may
come
in
answer
to
excuse
us

For
we
know
well
as
for
by
much
the
more
party
of
us
and
as
we
hope
for
all
all
such
wrongs
have
been
unknown
to
us
or
else
utterly
against
our
will

And
rightful
lords
for
one
the
greatest
remedy
with
others
for
to
again-stand
many
of
thilke
diseases
before
said
amongst
us
we
pray
with
mekeness
this
especially
that
the
statute
ordained
and
made
by
Parliament
held
at
Westminster
in
the
sixth
year
of
our
King
now
reigning
may
stand
in
strength
and
be
executed
as
well
here
in
London
as
else
where
in
the
realm
the
which
is
this

have
laid
the
siege

the
city
of
Rouen
which
is
the
most
notable
place
in
France
save
Paris
at
which
siege
us
needs
greatly
refreshing
for
us
and
for
our

thank
God

And
for as much
as
our
adverse
party
will
no
peace
nor
accord
have
with
us
but
finally
have
refused
all
means
of
peace
we
are
compelled
again
to
war
through
their
default
as
he
wot
that
all
knows

To
whose
mercy

trust
for
our

and
readiness
to

peace
to
have

And
as
to
the
said
aid
the
which
you
have
concluded
to
do
unto
us
now
at
this
time
we
pray
you
specially
that
we
may
have
it
at
such
time
and
in
such
ways
as
our
brother
of
Bedford
shall
more
plainly
declare
unto
you
on
our
behalf
letting
you
fully
wete
that
we
have
written
to
all
our
friends
and
allies
through
Christendom
for
to
have
succours
and
help
of
them
against
the
same
time
that
our
said
brother
shall
declare
you
the
which
when
they
hear
of
the arm
and
the array
that
you
and
others
of
our
subjects
make
at
home
in
help
of
us
shall
give
him
great
courage
to
haste
their
coming
unto
us
much
the
rather
and
not
fail
as
we
trust
fully

Wherefore
we
pray
you
heartily
that
you
would
do
touching
the
foresaid
aide
as
our
said
brother
shall
declare
unto
you
on
our
behalf
considering
that
so
necessary
nor
so
acceptable
a
service
as
you
may
do
and
will
do
as
we
trust
unto
you
at
this
time
you
not
might
never
have
done
unto
us
since
our
war
in
France
began

For
we
trust
fully
to
God's
might
and
his
mercy
with
good
help
of
you
and
of
our
land
to
have
a
good
end
of
our
said
war
in
short
time
and
for
to
come
home
unto
you
to
great
comfort
and
singular
joy
of
our
heart
as
God
knows
the
which
he
grant
us
to
his
pleasance
and
have
you
ever
in
his
keeping

Given
under
our
signet
in
our
Town
of
Pontoise
the
17
day
of
August

And
weteþ
that
the
foresaid
17
day
of
August
departed
from
us
at
Pontoise
our
letters
to
you
direct
in
this
same
tenure

And
by
cause
it
is
said
the
bearer
of
them
is
by
our
enemies
taken
in
to
Crotey
we
renew
them
here
at
Trye
the
Castle
the
12th
day
of
September

T

Tibbay

I
have
after
the
advice
of
your
letter
done
duely
examined
the
instrument
by
the
wisest
I
could
find
here
and
in
especial
by
one
Master
Robert
Sutton
a
courtesan
of
the
court
of
Rome
the
which
is
the
chief
and
most
cheer
man
with
my
Lord
of
Gloucester
and
his
matter
in
the
said
court
for
my
lady
his
wife

And
her
answer
is
that
all
this
process
though
it
were
indeed
proceeded
as
the
instrument
specifies
is
not
sufficient
in
the
law
of
Holy
Church
My
adversary
has
become
bishop
of
Cork
in
Ireland
and
there
are
2
other
persons
provided
to
the
same
bishopric
yet
living
before
my
said
adversary
and
by
this
acceptation
of
this
bishopric
he
has
prived
himself
of
the
title
that
he
claimed
in
Bromholm
and
so
anulled
the
ground
of
his
process
against
me

And
also
the
time
of
his
grievance
pretended
and
the
time
of
his
suit
he
was
apostate
and
I
trow
is
yet
and
so
unable
to
sue
any
such
process

I
purpose
me
to
come
homeward
by
London
to
learn
more
in
this
matter
if
I
may

I
pray
the
Holy
Trinity
Lord
of
your
church
and
of
all
the
world
deliver
me
of
my
3
adversaries
of
this
cursed
bishop
for
Bromholm
Aslak
for
Sprouston
and
Julian
Herberd
for
Thornham

I
have
not
trespassed
against
none
of
these
iii
God
knows
and
yet
I
am
foul
and
noisingly
vexed
with
them
to
my
great
unease
and
all
for
my
lords'
and
friends'
matters
and
not
for
my
own

I
wot
not
whether
it
were
best
in
any
sermon
or
other
audience
in
your
church
or
elsewhere
to
declare
aught
of
this
matter
in
stopping
of
the
noise
that
runs
in
this
case

I
submit
me
and
all
this
matter
to
your
good
discretion
and
every
gramercy
God
and
you
who
ever
have
you
and
me
in
his
gracious
governance

And
for as much
as
I
conceive
verily
that
you
are
vicar
general
in
England
of
the
worthy
prelate
the
Abbot
of
Cluny
and
have
his
power
in
many
great
articles
and
among
other
in
profession
of
monks
in
England
of
the
said
order

And
in
my
country
but
a
mile
from
the
place
where
I
was
born
is
the
poor
house
of
Bromholm
of
the
same
order
in
which
are
diverse
virtuous
young
men
monks
clad
and
unprofessed
that
have
abidden
there
without
abbot
9
or
10
years
and
by
longer
delay
of
their
profession
many
inconveniences
are
likely
to
fall

And
also
the
prior
of
the
said
house
has
resigned
into
your
worthy
hands
by
certain
notables
and
reasonables
causes
as
it
appears
by
an
instrument
and
a
simple
letter
under
the
commune
seal
of
the
said
house
of
Bromholm
which
the
bearer
of
this
has
ready
to
show
you

Whereupon
I
pray
you
with
all
my
heart
and
as
I
ever
may
do
you
service
that
it
like
to
your
grace
to
grant
of
your
charity
by
your
worthy
letters
to
the
prior
of
Thetford
in
Norfolk
of
the
said
order
of
Cluny
authority
and
power
as
your
minister
and
deputy
to
profess
in
due
form
the
said
monks
of
Bromholm
unprofessed

And
that
it
like
you
overmore
to
accept
and
admit
the
said
resignation
by
your
said
authority
and
power
with
the
favour
of
your
good
lordship
in
comfort
and
consolation
of
your
poor
priests
the
monks
of
the
said
house
of
Bromholm
and
thereup
to
grant
your
worthy
letters
witnessing
the
same
acceptation
and
admission
of
the
said
resignation
and
all
your

letters
to
deliver
to
my
clerk
to
whom
I
pray
you
to
give
faith
and
credence
touching
this
matter
and
to
deliver
him
in
all
the
haste
reasonable

And
I
am
your
man
and
ever

be
by
the

of
God
which
ever

Written

Yours
WILLIAM
PASTON
Warfield
I
greet
you
well
doing
you
to
wit
that
the
borrows
of
William
Spileman
and
Thomas
Spileman
have
be
with
me
since
that
I
spoke
with
you
last
and
desired
that
I
should
put
them
to
some
issue
how
they
might
try
themselves
free
or
bound
and
I
answered
them
that
there
is
a
common
law
to
all
the
King's
legee
people
the
which
is
open
to
all
men
that
will
sue
it
the
which
in
my
part
I
most
needs
abide
and
I
asked
the
borrows
if
they
would
sue
for
them
and
they
borrows
seyde
no
but
that
they
prayed
me
that
they
might
bring
in
to
me
the
two
brothers
and
their
goods
and
to
be
discharged
of
their
bonds
and
so
on
Wednesday
next
coming
they
borrows
will
be
with
me
to
bring
the
Spilemans
and
their
goods
to
me
hoping
to
be
discharged
of
their
bonds
And
as
it
is
do
me
to
understand
that
William
Spileman
says
that
though
I
have
all
his
goods
and
prison
his
body
he
will
never
acknowledge
him
bound
to
die
therefore
and
how
I
shall
govern
me
in
this
matter
I
pray
you
to
send
to
me
a
scrow

Also
forget
not
Fortescue
as
for
the
wood
at
Erm

And
I
pray
you
to
see
readily
the
diem
claus

extremum
of
the
lord
Saint
John

Also
I
pray
you
to
take
the
money
of
Clopton
and
bring
it
with
you

Also
speak
you
to
my
Master
when
Cricklade
and
W
to
meet
together
for
my
brother's
will

Thomas

Right

And
sir
if
there
be
anything
that
I
may
do
for
you
in
any
matter
in
time
coming
I
will
do
it
with
all
mine
heart
and
that
knows
God
who
have
you
in
his
blessed
keeping

To
the
worshipful
and
my
trusty
friend
Thomas
Stonor

Reverend
father
in
Christ
I
recommend
me
to
your
good
fatherhood
and
good
Lordship
shown
to
me
at
all
times
and
please
you
to
wit
that
this
country
that
I
am
in
stands
disjoint
and
in
great
peril
as
I
trow
you
have
heard
and
I
have
been
long
time
servant
to
saint
Cudbart
and
you
and
if
I
have
done
good
service
it
liked
me
well
and
if
I
have
done
other
way
me
repents

Nevertheless
since
I
have
been
to
you
a
long
servant
and
in
office
give
it
were
pleasing
to
your
Lordship
and
your
brother
I
deign
to
have
your
letters
thereof
for
term
of
my
life
and
to
have
my
pension
somewhat
amended
as
it
might
be
to
the
value
of
100
shillings
English
which
has
been
ever
before
but
to
the
value
of
5
marc
and
pence
English

And
if
this
can
be
done
I
will
bind
my
friends
and
myself
to
defend
your
right
at
our
power
and
if
it

I

that
I
might
have
had

that
I
had
not

be
not
defended
with

both
as
your

both
my

wit
that
Sir
Davy

has
had
great
labour
and
disease
and
oftentimes
has
been
in
great
peril
and
doubt
of
his
life
for
the
furtherance
and
the
rights
of
our

of
Coldingham
for
the
which
gentleness
and
kindness
will
that
I
and
my

more
favourable
to

we
have
granted
him
the
office
of
the
said
bailiery
for
certain
years
under
certain
conditions

And
as
your

well
knows
Sir
Alexander
Home
is
much
better
endowed
and
greater
of
livelihood
than

Sir
Davy
and
the

it
were

and
also

make
good
unity
and
peace
between
you

And
you
will
at
the
reverence
of
God
consider
how
that
God
has
endowed
you
with
greater
livelihood
than

so
that
sir

This
is
the
credence
made
to
my
lord
the
prior
of
Durham
and
the
convent
anemned
Aldcambos

Where
it
is
said
that
the
Prior
of
Coldingham
the
which
God
assoil
would
not
assent
to
the
said
change
of
that
action
there
evidence
bears
witness
and
thereto
I
refer
you
and
also
to
Dan
John
Penscher
that
had
the
oaths
of
the
said
prior
of
Coldingham
and
to
the
Prior
and
the
convent
of
Durham

And
also
I
am
informed
by
one
of
law
and
reputation
of
this
land
that
where
conditions
are
made
and
indented
before
notable
witness
as
will
unselled
as
selled
the
convention
shall
be
kept
of
both
the
parties
as
well
as
they
were
sold
and
interchanged
with
their
own
hands

And
suppose
the
evidence
were
undone
or
fraudfully
away
held
the
witness
beand
of
life
shall
bear
all
the
effect
of
the
said
evidence
so
that
the
condition
shall
be
all
in
the
sleight
after
as
they
were
accorded

And
as
touching
the
convention
of
Old
Cambos
I
shall
not
forget
it
and
condition
be
kept
at
the
least
the
which
I
think
not
to
go
from
while
I
have
brought
it
to
an
end
who
so
ever
trest
the
contrary

And
also
as
to
the
Prior
of
Coldingham
and
the
governance
of
the
place
and
the
freedom
thereof
then
the
said
Prior
and
I
come
from
Durham
he
would
never
be
governed
by
my
counsel
in
a
matter
nor
by
my
ordinance
but
as
Sir
Alexander
Home
would
inform
him

And
since
Sir
Alexander
Home
was
at
discussion
with
me
the
said
Prior
has
done
as
his
business
as
I
am
informed
to
further
the
said
Sir
Alexander
to
his
purpose
in
contrary
of
me
and
not
looking
to
the
avail
nor
the
freedom
of
the
house
nor
to
my
loyalty
that
I
am
bound
the
which
loyalty
I
shall
keep
for
any
peril
that
may
appear
God
willing
as
I
shall
answer
and
make
known
to
the
house
and
to
you

And
for
to
further
the
said
Sir
Alexander
the
said
Prior
has
put
the
house
in
peril
as
is
well
kend
to
the
country
and
for
this
cause
I
send
the
peril
appear
I
have
taken
the
strength
of
the
house
in
governance
because
I
knew
well
that
the
said
Sir
Alexander
would
have
taken
it
and
through
it
would
have
supplied
them
of
Downfirmyllyng
or
any
other
that
would
best
apply
to
his
governance
and
this
may
well
be
trowen
by
this
cause
for
I
proffered
to
our
friends
to
be
left
in
the
same
plight
as
I
found
it
so
that
he
would
find
surety
that
it
should
be
unkept
through
him
or
any
that
to
him
pertained
and
this
he
has
refused
the
which
I
am
bound
to
require
my
said
lord
the
Prior
and
the
convent
of
Durham
that
the
said
Prior
of
Coldingham
his
language
nor
writing
are
no
hindering
to
me
nor
to
my
masters
while
he
and
I
appear
in
proper
persons
before
the
chapter
and
all
the
brethren
that
best
know
my
government
the
which
appearance
shall
not
be
long
to
wit
my
assent
with
the
grace
of
God

And
because
of
this
language
he
hasted
him
the
sooner
and
passed
on
the
night
foroute
leavetaking
and
took
all
his
brethren
with
him
that
was
in
Coldingham

And
where
it
was
said
to
you
that
I
purposed
me
to
buy
a
tower
in
Aldcambos
and
had
laid
stones
on
the
ground
it
is
not
so
for
truly
I
nor
my
son
was
never
purposed
thereon
but
they
that
made
that
language
first
it
was
for
furthering
of
themselves
and
hindering
of
me

Wherefore
I
require
your
lordship
that
you
would
with
the
bearer
in
haste
write
to
the
Prior
of
Coldingham
that
he
made
no
secting
of
the
said
Aldcambos
while
he
and
I
compared
before
you
in
proper
persons
so
and
he
make
any
setting
of
the
said
place
I
shall
summon
him
before
the
king
or
his
justice
or
his
sheriff
which
pleases
me
best
and
by
the
law
of
this
land
compel
him
to
fulfil
both
the
tack
and
change
of
the
said
place
that
was
delivered
to
him
to
be
given
to
me
and
my
son
and
as
we
were
accorded
both
before
English
and
Scots
that
shall
be
witness
thereto

And
of
all
their
matters
what
time
that
I
and
my
son
come
to
your
lordship
we
will
be
more
ruled
by
you
and
your
chapter
than
be
any
that
lives
for
we
have
ever
been
much
behalden
thereto

And
of
any
discord
that
is
between
the
Prior
of
Coldingham
and
his
brother
that
there
is
and
me
I
shall
be
full
laght
that
it
is
hard
while
I
come
to
your
presence
so
that
he
give
nor
take
to
Sir
Alex
of
Aldcambos
and
if
he
does
I
require
your
lordship
to
hold
me
excused
to
make
such
present
to
me
as
before

Item
I
proferred
the
said
Prior
to
hold
his
court
and
set
his
land
at
his
own
will
and
thereby
have
fealty
of
his
tenants
and
as
yet
I
can
not
redo
him
thereto
and
whenever
him
list
there
shall
never
be
no
fault
in
me

Letter
to
the
king

Most
high
and
most
mighty
Prince
and
our
most
doubted
and
dreaded
Sovereign
Lord
After
the
most
lowly
recommendation
that
we
your
true
humble
subjects
and
servants
may
or
can
in
any
manner
unto
your
royal
majesty
do
or
devise
please
it
your
said
royal
majesty
to
have
in
knowledge
that
we
your
said
subjects
and
servants
with
all
our
fellowship
in
good
health
of
body
blessed
be
God
came
and
arrived
to
this
your
noble
city
of
Bordeaux
on
Monday
the
16
day
of
July
where
at
our
first
coming
we
found
as
sorrowful
a
town
and
as
greatly
dismayed
and
discouraged
as
any
might
be
in
the earth
as
people
desolate
and
cast
out
of
all
comfort
of
any
security
to
be
had
from
your
said
majesty
against
your
enemies
that
been
in
this
country
in
great
puissance
and
after
deliverance
made
unto
them
of
the
town
of
Tarteys
have
got
by
assault
the
town
of
Saint
Severs
and
also
have
won
and
subdued
all
the
country
of
the
land
except
Bayon
and
Aix

So
that
all
that
country
was
waxen
almost
rebel
within
8
days
as
well
barons
as
gentils
and
others

And
now
your
said
enemies
are
before
the
said
city
of
Aix
holding
their
siege
there
round
about
it
in
great
multitude
of
men
of
arms
and
another
party
of
their
puissance
under
the
Lord
Powns
and
other
have
laid
siege
to
Sursak
which
is
but
a
day
and
a
half
journey
from
this
your
city
of
Bordeaux
as
men
say
here

And
as
tidings
are
come
late
from
your
town
of
Bayon
your
enemies
purposen
to
make
4
bastilles
about
the
said
town
of
Aix
and
stuff
therein
with
3
or
4
thousand
men
of
arms
and
the
remnant
will
depart
and
besiege
your
said
town
of
Bayon
and
so
they
enforce
themselves
in
one
time
to
get
both
towns
and
so
straight
to
come
down
hither
and
besiege
this
your
town
of
Bordeaux

Your
adversary
of
France
and
his
son
which
calls
himself
dauphin
have
been
and
are
in
proper
person
on
the
field
in
all
this
voyage

Not
only
these
great
enterprises
and
the
mighty
puissance
of
your
said
enemies
caused
the abashment
of
your
true
people
of
this
your
city
of
Bordeaux
but
more
without
comparison
the
letters
which
were
sent
from
your
highness
under
your
private
seal
and
born
hider
by
one
that
calls
himself
Frauncois
whose
name
in
deed
Juon
Goer
and
delivered
to
diverse
estates
here
the
Sunday
before
our
arrival
in
the
which
Sunday
the
said
Francois
and
others
were
set
on
land
at
Castellion
and
from
thence
rode
by
land
unto
Bordeaux
before
our
coming
had
reported
and
noised
through
the
city
that
they
should
no
succours
have
and
as
them
seemed
the
letters
meant
the
same
so
that
at
our
coming
the
city
was
full
of
rumour
and
of
sorrow
and
had
no
other
trust
belief
nor
concept
but
that
they
were
abandoned
and
cast
away
forever

But
blessed
be
God
which
as
we
believe
verily
in
a
good
hour
sent
us
hither
for
your
well
Sovereign
Lord
and
of
your
country
here
by
our
coming
and
arriving
all
your
city
was
greatly
recomforted
and
in
especial
by
the
comfortable
report
of
your
succours
to
be
had
in
haste
which
to
their
greatest
joy
and
gladness
we
showed
and
declared
unto
them
after
the
form
of
your
gracious
letters
given
under
your
signet
of
the eagle
at
your
castle
of
Windsor
the
24
day
of
June
and
sent
unto
us
at
Plymouth
the
which
your
letters
we
showed
openly
and
read
them
before
all
your
Counsel
and
other
estates
here
the
Tuesday
next
following
and
after
their
desire
we
did
them
to
be
translated
in
to
French
and
delivered
them
to
the
most
Reverend
Father
in
God
the archbishop
of
this
city
which
the
Wednesday
next
following
making
right
a
good
and
a
right
stirring
collection
in
his
cathedral
church
read
and
declared
the
said
letters
so
translated
openly
in
the
pulpit
before
all
the
people
rehearsing
the
good
and
tender
zeal
that
you
have
to
the
conservation
and
the
well
of
this
your
city
and
of
all
your
true
subjects
in
these
parties
and
putting
them
out
of
doubt
of
succours
to
be
had
in
right
brief
time
exciting
them
furthermore
and
exhorting
by
the
faith
and
leégeance
that
they
owe
to
your
highness
to
do
all
their
pain
labour
and
true
diligence
about
the
defence
and
safeguard
of
your
city
in
the
mean
time
and
so
in
truth
they
have
done
and
do
daily
in
the
best
wise
and
have
fortified
the
said
city
with
bulwarks
guns
engines
and
all
other
necessary
habiliments
in
the
strongest
wise
and
also
scoured
and
pared
the
ditches
and
made
their
town
in
all
parts
so
ready
and
so
mighty
that
in
our
concept
they
are
great
and
notably
thankworthy

And
for
sooth
Sovereign
Lord
we
have
not
ceased
nor
cease
daily
to
give
them
comfort
and
courage
offering
ourselves
and
our
poor
company
to
be
ready
at
all
times
to
help
them
and
strengthen
them
in
as
much
as
in
us
is
for
the
defense
and
saving
of
the
city
abiding
here
with
them
still
for
as
yet
we
can
not
conceive
that
we
shall
move
hanging
this
war
will
pass
any
further
after
the
nature
and
quality
of
our

Most

our

dread
Sovereign
Lord
After
our
most
humble
recommendation
please
it
your
high
and
noble
grace
as
for
tidings
from
this
your
country
of
Guienne
to
wit
that
after
your
adversary
of
France
had
taken
your
town
of
Saint
Sever
and
your
city
of
Aix
and
put
under
his
obeisance
the
country
of
the
Lawndes
he
drew
himself
down
towards
this
your
city
of
Bordeaux
by
the
river
of
Garonne
where
in
right
brief
time
he
has
got
and
taken
the
towns
and
castles
and
fortresses
whose
names
are
specified
in
the
schedule
here
enclosed

And
after
that
he
had
the
town
of
Marmande
he
abode
there
with
right
little
puissance
3
weeks
and
more
so
that
by
all
likelihood
if
any
stuff
or
power
of
English
people
had
been
here
he
might
never
have
had
escaped
by
reason
untaken

And
since then
he
has
of
new
increased
his
army
and
after
that
sieged
and
taken
your
town
and
castle
of
Mavesyn
and
upon
that
the
3
day
of
this
present
month
he
laid
siege
to
your
town
and
castle
of
Rieul
which
is
but
7
leagues
from
this
your
city
of
Bordeaux
the
which
town
he
got
with
an
assault
the
8
day
of
this
same
month
and
slew
therein
many
people

Also

your
royal
Majesty
furthermore
to
know
that
after
that

and
your
town
of
Saint
Sever

had
in
knowledge
by
such
passages
as

from

town
of

sithen
the
departing
of

this
time
was
no
manner
of
navir
for
to
pass
in

Your
said
adversary
has
commanded
the Earl
of

trust
he
has
laid
the
siege
before
this

And
here
may
be
had
no
comfort
of
succours
to
help
them
with
for
we
have
nothing
wherewith
to
help
ourselves
the
which
causes
great
heaviness
desolation
and
sorrow
amongst
all
your
people
here
seeing
that
after
promise
of
succours
declared
unto
them
by
your
commandment
has
passed
so
long
a
time
and
no
comfort
comes
not
so
much
in
all
this
time
as
one
balinger
to
revive
their
hearts
and
put
them
in
good
trust
and
hope
of
comfort

Truly
in
concept
of
your
true
men
here
a
little
number
of
good
men
sent
hither
by
time
as
it
was
promised
might
have
kept
your
country
from
this
great
hurt
which
20
thousand
will
not
now
by
many
days
lightly
recover
and
yet
furthermore
if
your
merchants
had
been
suffered
to
pass
hither
for
the
vintage
in
such
time
as
they
have
been
accustomed
in
years
before
doubtless
your
enemies
would
not
have
abidden
to
do
this
great
harm
that
they
have
done
and
daily
do

God
send
us
hasty
tidings
for
comfort
of
your
people
here
which
in
truth
as
in
our
opinion
stood
never
so
dismayed
before
this
time

By
these
tidings
most
gracious
sovereign
lord
you
may
clearly
understand
how
the
ways
of
our

been
impeached

Master
John
de
Batute
has
written
to
us
your
said
adversary
by
no
manner
of
mean
may
be
induced
to
grant
us
his
letters
of
safe conduct
and
so
it
is
not

to
us
possible
as
yet
in
any
manner
of
wise
to
pass
upward
in
surete
of
our
persons

Wherefore
please
it
your
high
and
noble
grace
to
let
us
have
knowledge
of
your
gracious
pleasure

it

a
knowledge

all
other
things
that
have

unto
me
since
my
coming
in
to
my
cure
here
to
be
reformed
and
corrected
on
the
greatest
and
most
grievous
of
open
disobedience
and
rebellion
against
God
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
Church
has
been
made
unto
me
with
great
cry
and
sorrowful
complaint
against
certain
tenants
of
yours
at
Shirborne
and
others
inhabiting
your
town
of
Langport
which
as
men
lawless
neither
dreading
God
nor
living
after
the
laws
of
holy
Church
without
any
priest
or
clerk
presume
to
do
sacraments
of
the
church
as
in
burying
the
dead
and
will
not
suffer
their
curate
which
under
God
and
me
has
cure
of
their
souls
to
do
divine
service
nor
to
minister
unto
them
any
of
the
sacraments
of
the
Church
nor
none
of
my
ministers
or
officers
to
do
any
correction
of
their
trespasses
in
salvation
of
their
souls

They
beat
also
and
vex
the
poor
people
dwelling
there
about
as
well
my
servants
as
others
that
in
places
where
they
been
there
dare
none
of
them
come
for
fear
of
losing
their
lives

Many
other
offenses
and
damnable
deeds
they
use
and
do
that
grievous
and
sorrowful
is
to
hear

My
Lord
it
is
said
that
all
this
they
do
under
boldness
of
you
and
your
mighty
lordship
albeit
that
I
verily
trow
and
suppose
that
and
you
had
understanding
and
knowledge
of
this
their
misgovernance
and
sinful
and
obstinate
living
you
would
--
as
a
true
knight
to
God
and
holy
Church
as
well
for
your
own
duty
and
true
acquittal
that
as
God's
knight
you
owe
to
him
and
to
his
church
as
for
the
merit
of
your
soul
in
chastising
of
such
sinful
living
and
rebellion
against
the
church
to
whose
defense
the
sword
is
delivered
unto
you
-

exhort
and
stir
all
those
to
whom
should
belong
the
prevention
and
redress
in
that
behalf
to
do
and
execute
the
same
truly
diligently
and
goodly
as
their
duty
is
their
office
and
their
power
giving
in
it
if
need
were
your
mighty
assistance
and
aid
as
God's
law
and
holy
church's
also
requires
and
commands

Truly
my
lord
any
true
Christian
prince
may
well
understand
that
where
as
true
obeisance
is
suffered
to
be
withdrawn
from
God
and
his
church
it
must
soon
after
by
God's
rightful
doom
and
punishment
be
withdrawn
from
man
that
suffers
and
helps
it
to
be
done

Worthy
sirs
I
greet
you
well
all
doing
you
to
understand
that
I
rode
from
Exeter
on
Friday
and
came
to
London
on
Tuesday
by
time
at
7
o'clock
and
there
since
then
have
full
busily
laboured
to
make
an
answer
to
the
articles

The
cause
of
so
long
tarying
in
making
of
the
answers
has
been
for
right
great
business
that
Alisaunder
Hody
has
had
about
his
own
matters
nevertheless
by
the
advice
of
Alisauder
Hody
and
Dowrisshe
and
Roger
Rawly
they
both
made
as
may
be
in
so
short
time
trusting
to
God
that
all
the
substance
is
comprehended
therein
so
that
what
time
it
is
amended
corrected
and
made
by
advice
of
counsel
to
be
right
well
of
the
which
answers
so
shortly
made
I
sent
to
you
2
copies
one
to
be
sent
to
the
Recorder
in
haste
if
it
may
be
for
shortness
of
time
etc.
that
other
copy
to
abide
with
you
praying
you
Thomas
Cook
most
specially
with
the
lieutenant
calling
to
you
William
Noble
Coteler
Druell
and
others
whom
you
seem
is
to
be
done
and
that
this
answer
is
sadly
overseen
and
if
anything
is
therein
too
much
or
too
little
in
substance
to
set
the
pen
to
sadly

This
do
I
pray
you
to
call
before
you
at
all
the
substance
of
the
commonalty
praying
every
of
them
in
my
name
and
charging
them
in
the
most
straightest
wise
in
the
King's
behalf
to
come
before
you
in
haste
for
the
tidings
that
I
have
sent
home
to
you
and
that
you
wisely
declare
before
them
these
answers
so
that
they
see
mainly
yes
and
no
in
such
points
as
you
think
to
be
done
etc.
and
that
they
will
abide
by
the
answers
in
all
ways
and
that
labour
and
speaking
are
before
to
that
intent

This
do
I
pray
you
that
I
have
a
good
man
sent
to
me
in
haste

to
London-ward
for
needs
of
the
city
that
is
to
say
to
keep
the
day
of
appearance
at

as
the

with
them
sufficient
power
and
the

seal
and
40

And
as

said
40 shillings
with
40 shillings
more
that
the

The
Tuesday
he
rode
and
with
him
William
Hampton
and
John
Fagot

On
Wednesday
at
night
they
came
to
Shaftesbury
and
there
met
with
Richard
Druell
which
made
report
of
his
good
speed
and
great
labour
at
London
as
it
appears
in
his
said
remembrance
and
that
on
the
best
wise

The
Saturday
next
thereafter
the
mayor
came
to
Westminster
soon
upon
9
at the
bell
and
there
met
with
my
lord
Chanceller
at the
broad
door
a
little
from
the
stair
foot
coming
from
the
Steer/Control
chamber
I
in
the
court
and
by
the
door
kneeling
and
saluting
him
in
the
most
goodly
wise
that
I
could
and
recommended
in
to
his
God
and
gracious
lordship

fellowship
and
all
the
communalty
his
own
people
and
beadsmen
of
the
City
of
Exeter

He
said
to
the
mayor
2
times
"
Welcome
and
the
3rd
time
"
Right
welcome
Mayor
and
held
the
mayor
a
great
while
fast
by
the
hand
and
so
went
forth
to
his
barge
and
with
him
great
press
lords
and
others
etc.
and
in
especial
the
tresurer
of
the
King's
household
with
whom
he
was
at
right
great
private
communication

And
therefore
I
mayor
drew
me
apart
and
met
with
him
at
his
going
in
to
his
barge
and
there
took
my
leave
of
him
saying
these
words
"
My
lord
I
will
await
upon
your
good
lordship
and
your
better
leisure
at
another
time

He
said
to
me
again
"
Mayor
I
pray
you
heartily
that
you
do
so
and
that
you
speak
with
the
Chief
Justice
and
what
time
that
ever
he
will
I
will
be
all
ready

And
thus
departed
etc.

The
Sunday
about
8
at the
clock
I
came
to
Lambeth
and
with
me
Dowrissh
and
Speere
to
meet
and
speak
with
my
said
lord

I
mayor
prayed
him
of
one
a
word
at
that
time
and
no
more
I
saying
that
I
was
informed
that
he
was
displeased
of
my
late
coming
and
if
he
so
were
I
besought
him
to
hire
my
excuse
great

He
said
"
No
but
that
I
was
come
in
right
good
time
and
well
come
and
at
his
departing
in
to
his
closet
he
said
"
Mayor
would
God
you
had
made
a
good
end
at
home

And
I
said
"
Would
God
my
lord
that
we
so
had
and
God
I
take
to
record
I
have
done
my
due
diligent
part
thereto
and
that
in
time
I
trust
to
God
you
shall
well
know
for
I
have
right
many
things
to
inform
you
of
if
I
had
time

He
said
"
Well
mayor
and
bade
me
come
again
that
same
day
afternoon
and
so
departed
etc.

I
was
by
the
Styward
and
many
other
of
the
household
full
fair
I
bade
to
abide
at
meat
nor
never
had
better
cheer
of
my
lord
nor
of
the
household
then
I
had
at the
time

Nevertheless
I
excused
me
and
would
not
abide
as
for
time

And
so
went
over
the
water
to
Temple
to
Bluet
etc.
and
so
went
with
Bluet
Dowrissh
Speere
and
I
to
the
chief
justice
and
commoned
of
many
things
with
him

He
is
likely
as
I
conceive
to
have
the
great
rule
in
this
matter
for
my
lord
Chancellor
said
as
it
is
abovesaid
that
he
would
attend
when
the
justice
would
the
which
I
said
to
the
justice

God
have
grace
it
is
good
and
so
I
trust
to
God
that
it
be

That
afternoon
I
went
again
to
Lambeth
to
my
lord
after
his
commandment
abovesaid
and
when
I
came
thither
to
him
in
his
inner
chamber
there
was
much
people
lords
and
others
my
lord
Treasurer
under-treasurer
the
privy
seal
land
dyvours
abbots
and
priors
and
many
strangers
alien
of
other
lands

And
then
came
in
the
Duke
of
Bokingham
and
there
was
great
business
at
that
time
hardly
all
men
were
bid
to
avoid
that
chamber
safe
the
lords

Nevertheless
I
awaited
my
time
and
put
me
in
press
and
went
right
to
my
lord
Chancellor
and
said
"
My
lord
I
am
come
at
your
commandment
but
I
see
your
great
business
is
such
that
you
may
not
attend

He
said
"
No
by
his
truth
and
that
I
might
right
well
see

I
said
"
Yee
and
that
I
was
sorry
and
had
pity
of
his
great
vexation

He
said
"
Mayor
I
must
tomorrow
ride
by
time
to
the
King
and
come
again
this
week
you
must
await
upon
my
coming
and
then
I
will
speak
with
the
justice
and
attend
for
you
etc
I
said
"
My
lord
I
will
do
after
your
commandment
and
prayed
him
of
his
good
and
gracious
lordship
of
no
word
more
if
he
were
informed
by
word
or
by
writing
of
anything
that
I
have
done
or
said
or
governed
me
in
any
wise
at
home
since
the
last
term
my
departing
from
him
otherwise
than
to
his
pleasure
and
after
his
commandment

He
said
right
heartily
"
No
but
that
I
had
governed
me
at
home
in
the
most
best
and
goodly
wise
and
therefore
he
owed
me
great
thank
and
said
heartily
that
I
should
have
God's
blessing
and
his
therefore
etc.

After
recommendation
had
in
the
most
goodly
wise
you
shall
say
to
my
lord
that
the
Mayor
gives
you
in
commandment
to
say
that
my
lord
Chancellor
greets
him
well
and
sends
him
the
letter
beseeching
him
of
his
good
lordship
advisedly
to
oversee
it
whereupon
as
you
suppose
after
the
intent
of
the
letter
that
you
must
speak
much
more
with
him
also
beseeching
him
of
his
good
lordship
at the
reverence
of
my
lord
Chancellor
to
give
leisure
and
attendance
thereto
saying
also
that
it
is
the
Mayor's
part
to
have
come
himself
with
the
letter
and
excuse
etc
and
then
how
dangerous
it
was
to
make
any
worthy
man
to
come
to
him
at
time
for
strange
cheer
at
Clist
etc
and
that
the
Mayor
excused
him
against
my
said
lord
Chancellor
to
bring
the
letter
etc.
and
promised
to
send
of
the
most
worthiest
that
he
has
etc.

Item
that
you
recommend
my
lord
Chancellor
in
the
most
best
and
trusty
wise
and
that
it
is
his
commandment
and
other
lords'
and
long
time
has
been
that
we
should
intreat
at
home
the
which
has
been
the
Mayor's
great
labour
the
great
part
of
all
this
year
and
might
not
be
excepted
thereto
and
so
he
has
reported
before
the
lords
as
well
as
the
first
coming
to
him
to
Clist
to
seek
his
good
lordship
and
appease
for
his
excuse
and
yet
the
Mayor
and
the
city
now
as
well
as
before
this
time
by
commandment
of
the
lords
and
by
their
own
good
will
prays
and
desires
that
the
matter
might
be
disclosed
before
his
good
lordship
the
Mayor
the
Recorder
with
others
of
the
City
at
his
pleasure
being
present
trusting
to
God
verily
all
for
the
best
and
much
the
rather
and
the
better
to
have
a
good
end
as
law
reason
and
right
good
conscience
require
he
to
fell
all
the
matters
and
so
as
you
suppose
to
be
his
own
judge
and
end
much
of
the
matters
by
his
own
conscience
we
knowing
his
blessedness
and
good
conscience
etc.

Furthermore
you
shall
say
as
for
the
Mayor
where
my
said
lord
has
said
and
send
him
word
that
he
is
not
the
man
that
he
weened
that
he
had
been
the
which
word
is
to
him
right
heavy
and
says
that
he
shall
find
him
the
same
one
man
and
same
true
man
as
he
has
been
and
so
he
trusts
to
God
he
is
taken
and
known
among
the
lords
above
but
though
he
and
others
labour
for
the
right
of
the
City
with
true
means
as
he
has
done
and
none
otherwise
as
it
shall be
well
proved
it
is
no
cause
etc
they
both
sworn
thereto
as
he
is
to
the
right
of
his
benefit

Make
you
much
of
this
matter
and
of
the
judge
saying
and
of
the
short
cheer
Cliste
and
the
good
cheer
that
the
Mayor
had
in
his
closet
bringing
Coteler
to
his
good
grace
I
yet
praying
the
same
if
I
may
be
heard
and
that
you
desire
his
good
leisure
now
and
but
if
you
may
now

come

To
Edmond
Paston
of
Clifford's
Inn

London
be
this
letter
taken

TO
mine
welbeloved
son

I
greet
you
well
and
advise
you
to
think
once
of
the
day
of
your
father's
council
to
learn
the
law
for
he
said
many
times
that
whosoever
should
dwell
at
Paston
should
have
need
to
can
defend
himself

The
vicar
of
Paston
and
your
father
in
Lent
last
was
were
through
and
accorded
and
*landmarks
set
how
broad
the
way
should
be
and
now
he
has
pulled
up
the
*landmarks
and
says
he
will
make
a
ditch
from
the
corner
of
his
wall
right
over
the
way
to
the
new
ditch
of
the
great
close

I
sent
you
not
this
letter
to
make
you
weary
of
Paston
for
I
leave
in
hope
and
you
will
learn
that
they
shall
be
made
weary
of
their
work
for
in
good
faith
I
dare
well
say
it
was
your
father's
last
will
to
have
done
right
well
to
that
place
and
that
can
I
show
of
good
proof
though
men
would
say
no

God
make
you
right
a
good
man
and
send
God's
blessing
and
mine

Norwich

Thursday
after
Candelmess
Day

By
your
mother
Agnes
Paston

Trusty
and
wellbeloved
brother
I
greet
you
oftentimes
well
and
I
suppose
it
be
not
unknown
to
you
the
good
diligent
ruthful
and
notable
costs
and
labour
made
in
the
court
of
Rome
for
reduction
of
patronage
of
our
churches
within
the
diocese
of
Saint
Andrews
in
Scotland
by
my
brother
Dan
John
Oll
subprior
late
prior
of
Coldyngham
which
of
long
time
to
right
great
hurt
and
importable
likely
to
fall
to
the
said
priory
for
diverse
considerations
has
been
out
of
our
possession
for
which
our
said
brother
not
againstanding
great
labour
and
cost
made
in
the
court
of
Rome
and
our
evidence
right
pregnant
and
good
as
the
composition
made
between
the
predecessors
of
the
Bishop
of
Saint
Andrews
and
us
purports
and
openly
shows
could
no
way
go
through
with
him
to
have
his
good
lordship
and
will
or
our
said
brother
your
predecessor
paid
to
him
150
of
Scottish
money
which
some
he
borrowed
of
right
notable
merchant
and
Saint
Cuthbert
steadfast
and
true
friend
George
of
Fullay
dwelling
in
Edinburgh
and
bound
him
and
his
successors
in
an
obligation
to
pay
the
said
George
the
foresaid
150
at
Saint
John's
day
baptist
now
late
ago
for
which
payment
he
left
at
Coldingham
beside
the
stuff
of
the
said
place
to
pay
the
foresaid
sum
of
324
ewes
and
12
cows
with
the
offal
and
all
manner
of
profits
coming
both
of
the
ewes
and
cows
since
that
time
to
now
which
goods
you
have
taken
to
you
at
this
time
as
it
is
said

Therefore
I
considering
duly
the
notable
causes
and
ground
how
the
said
money
was
borrowed
and
spent
for
the
great
weal
of
the
said
place
of
Coldingham
for
evermore
me
seems
good
reason
and
according
the
same
place
bear
the
charge
since
the
weal
and
profit
abides
therewith

Wherefore
I
pray
you
effectually
that
you
dispose
you
in
all
goodly
haste
thankfully
to
pay
and
seize
the
said
George
of
the
150

aforesaid
as
right
and
reason
will
that
my
brother
late
your
predecessor
truth
be
kept
and
that
no
disturbance
fall
to
the
place
for
the
non-payment
thereof

And
what
you
purpose
to
do
in
this
matter
you
will
certify
me
by
your
writing
in
good
haste

And
our
Lord
preserve
you
from
all
adversities

to

Address
To

Paston
dwelling

the
Temple
at
London
be
this
letter
delivered
in
haste

I
greet
you
well
and
let
you
wit
that
Warne
Harman
on
the
Sunday
after
Halowmess
Day
after
eveningsong
said
openly
in
the
church
yard
that
he
knew
well
that
and
the
wall
were
put
down
though
he
was
a
hundred
miles
from
Paston
he
knew
well
that
I
would
say
he
did
it
and
he
should
bear
the
blame
saying
`Tell
it
hear
whoso
will
though
it
should
cost
me
20
nobles
it
shall
be
put
down
again.'
And
the
said
Warny's
wife
with
a
loud
voice
said
`All
the
devils
of
hell
draw
her
soul
to
hell
for
the
way
that
she
had
made.'
And
at
evening
a
certain
man
suppered
with
me
and
told
me
that
the
patent
granted
to
enclose
but
a
perch
on
bred
and
that
I
had
enclosed
more
than
the
grant
of
the
patent
is
as
men
said

And
John
Marchall
told
me
that
there
was
a
thrifty
woman
come
*close by
the
watering
and
found
the
way
stopped
and
asked
him
who
had
stopped
the
way
and
he
said
they
that
had
power
to
give
it
and
asked
her
what
was
freer
than
gift

And
she
said
she
saw
the
day
that
Paston
men
would
not
have
suffered
that

And
God
be
with
you

Address
To
John
Paston
dwelling
in
the
Temple
at
London
be
this
letter
delivered
in
haste

I
greet
you
well
and
let
you
*know
that
on
the
Sunday
before
Saint
Edmund
after
eveningsong
Agnes
Ball
came
to
me
to
my
closet
and
bad
me
good
evening
and
Clement
Spicer
with
her

And
I
asked
him
what
he
would
and
he
asked
me
why
I
had
stopped
in
the
King's
way

And
I
said
to
him
I
stopped
no
way
but
my
own
and
asked
him
why
he
had
sold
my
land
to
John
Ball
and
he
swore
he
was
never
accorded
with
your
father

And
I
told
him
if
his
father
had
done
as
he
did
he
would
have
been
ashamed
to
have
said
as
he
said

And
all
that
time
Waryn
Herman
leaned
over
the
enclosure
and
listened
what
we
said
and
said
that
the
change
was
a
ruly
change
for
the
*enclosure
was
undone
thereby
and
is
the
worse
by
one
100
pounds

And
I
told
him
it
was
no
courtesy
to
meddle
him
in
a
matter
but
if
he
were
called
to
council

And
proudly
going
forth
with
me
in
the
church
he
said
the
stopping
of
the
way
should
cost
me
20
nobles
and
yet
it
should
down
again

Then
he
asked
me
why
I
had
away
his
hey
at
Walsam
saying
to
me
he
would
he
had
known
it
when
it
was
carried
and
he
should
have
letted
it
and
I
told
him
it
was
my
own
ground
and
for
my
own
I
would
hold
it
and
he
bad
me
take
4
acres
and
go
no
further

And
thus
shortly
he
departed
from
me
in
the
church
yard

your

Agnes
Paston

Right
wellbeloved
friend
I
greet
you
heartily
well
thanking
you
entirely
for
all
your

done
and
shown
to
me
and
my
brothers
aforetime
praying
you
of
your
good
and
effectual
continuance

For
as
much
as
I
have
written
before
time
to
your
cousin
master
John
Laxe
our
procurator
in
the
court
for
our
cell
of
Coldingham
in
the
which
matter
I
had
no
certain
knowledge
what
labour
or
soot
is
made
against
us
therefore
I
pray
you
that
you
will
write
tenderly
to
the
said
M.
John
Laxe
that
he
would
certify
me
by
writing
how
the
matter
is
prosecuted
in
the
court
and
in
the
meantime
I
shall
provide
for
necessary
cost
and
expense
for
the
good
speed
and
furtherance
of
the

of
our

that
by

the

and
devotion
that
should
be
offered
to
almighty
God
for
remedy
and
release
of
pain
is
lessened
and
diminished
great
apparel
and
conscience
to
all
them
that
give
cause
or
favour
herein

all
these

duly
weighed
by

I

you
to

needs

to
Jesus
never
shall

he
is
full
kinde

is
as

an
hurt

not
make
an
end
with
none
of
his
other
sureties
without
this
said
silver
and
that
can
my
brother
John
tell
you
well
enough
and
it
lusts
him
to
do
so

By
your
humble
daughter
ELIZABETH
POYNINGS
Sir
I
recommend
me
to
you

Please it
you
to
wit
that
upon
Wednesday
last
passed
my
cousin
Langforth
his
son
brought
you
a
privy
seal
and
to
all
the
gentlemen
of
the
shire

So
I
received
sore
against
my
will

I
desired
of
him
to
have
kept
it
still
for
you
were
not
at
home
but
he
would
not
so
do
but
counseled
me
to
send it
you
in
all
haste

And
he
promises
me
that
he
would
inform
the
king
that
you
were
not
at
home
and
he
told
me
that
upon
the
Thursday
following
the
king
removes
northward
and
purposes
into
Scotland
if
then
he
comes
again

For
that
other
party
has
beseeched
the
castle
that
was
late
rescued
and
there
is
of
them
more
than
5000

RIGHT
worshipful
husband
I
recommend
me
to
you

Please
you
to
know
that
I
send
you
a
copy
of
a
deed
that
John
Edmondys
of
Taveram
sent
to
me
by
the
means
of
Dorlet

He
told
Dorlet
that
he
had
such
a
deed
as
he
supposed
that
would
do
ease
in
proving
of
the
title
that
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
claims
in
Drayton

For
the
same
deed
that
he
sent
me
the
seal
of
arms
is
like
unto
the
copy
that
I
send
you
and
nothing
like
to
the
Duke
of
Suffolk's
ancestors
Item
John
Russe
sent
me
word
that
Barker
and
Harry
Porter
told
him
in
council
that
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
has
bought
one
Brytyeff
right
the
which
makes
a
claim
unto
Heylysdon
and
the
said
Duke
is
proposed
to
enter
within
short
time
after
Easter
for
in
so
much
the
said
Russe
felt
by
the
said
Barker
and
Porter
that
all
the
feoffees
will
make
a
release
unto
the
Duke
and
help
him
that
they
can
into
their
power
for
to
have
his
good
lordship
Item
I
understand
by
John
Pampyng
that
you
will
not
that
your
son
be
taken
into
your
house
nor
helped
by
you
till
such
time
of
year
as
he
was
put
out
thereof
the
which
shall
be
about
Saint
Thomas
Mess

For
God's
sake
Sir
have
pity
on
him
and
remember
you
it
has
been
a
long
season
since
he
had
out
of
you
to
help
him
with
and
he
has
obeyed
him
to
you
and
will
do
at
all
times
and
will
do
that
he
can
or
may
to
have
your
good
fatherhood

And
at
the
reverence
of
God
be
you
his
good
father
and
have
a
fatherly
heart
to
him
and
I
hope
he
shall
ever
know
himself
the
better
herafter
and
be
the
more
aware
to
eschew
such
things
as
should
displease
you
and
for
to
take
heed
at
that
should
please
you

Pecock
shall
tell
you
by
mouth
of
more
things
than
I
may
write
to
you
at
this
time

M.
P

Address
To
my
master
John
Paston
the
oldest
be
this
delivered
in
haste

Right
worshipful
husband
I
recommend
me
unto
you

Please
you
to
*know
that
on
Wednesday
last
past
Dabeney
Naunton
Wykys
and
John
Love
were
at
Drayton
for
to
speak
with
your
tenants
there
to
put
them
in
comfort
and
for
to
ask
money
of
them
also

And
Pyrs
Waryn
otherwise
called
Pyrs
at
Sloth
which
is
a
flickering
fellow
and
a
busy
with
Master
Philip
and
the
bailiff
of
Cosshay
he
had
a
plough
going
in
your
land
in
Drayton
and
there
your
said
servants
at
that
time
took
his
plough
ware
that
is
to
say
2
mares
and
brought
them
to
Haylysdon
and
there
they
are
yet

And
on
the
next
morning
after
Master
Philip
and
the
bailiff
of
Cosshay
came
to
Haylysdon
with
a
great
number
of
people
that
is
to
say
8
men
and
more
in
harness
and
there
took
from
the
parson's
plough
2
horse
price
4
mark
and
2
horse
of
Thomas
Stermyn's
plough
price
40
shillings
saying
to
himself
that
there
was
taken
a
plaint
against
them
in
the
hundred
by
the
said
Pyrs
for
taking
off
the
foresaid
ploughware
at
Drayton
and
but
they
would
be
bound
to
come
of
Drayton
on
Tuesday
next
coming
to
answer
to
such
matters
as
shall
be
said
to
them
there
they
should
not
have
their
beasts
again
which
they
refused
to
do
unto
the
time
that
they
had
an
awnswer
from
you
and
so
they
led
the
beasts
forth
to
Drayton
and
from
Drayton
forth
to
Cosshay

And
the
same
afternoon
following
the
parson
of
Haylesdon
sent
his
man
to
Drayton
with
Stermyn
for
to
speak
with
Master
Philipp
to
know
a
way
if
they
should
have
again
their
cattle
or
not
and
Master
Philip
answered
them
if
that
they
would
bring
home
their
distress
again
that
was
taken
of
Pyrs
Waryn
that
then
he
would
deliver
them
theirs
or
else
not

And
he
let
them
plainly
*know
that
if
you
or
any
of
your
servants
took
any
distress
in
Drayton
that
were
but
the
value
of
a
hen
they
would
come
to
Haylesdon
and
take
there
the
value
of
an
ox
therefore
and
if
they
cannot
take
the
value
thereof
there
that
then
they
will
do
break
your
tenant's
houses
in
Haylesdon
and
take
as
much
as
they
could
find
therein
and
if
they
be
letted
thereof--
which
shall
never
lie
in
your
power
for
to
do
for
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
is
able
to
keep
daily
in
his
house
more
men
then
Dabeney
had
heres
in
his
head
if
him
liked
(
'and
as
for
Dabeney
he
is
a
lewd
fellow
and
so
he
shall
be
served
hereafter
and
I
would
that
he
were
here'
-
and
therefore
he
said
if
you
take
upon
you
to
let
them
so
for
to
do
that
then
they
would
go
into
any
lifehood
that
you
had
in
Norfolk
or
Suffolk
and
to
take
a
distress
in
like
wise
as
they
would
do
at
Haylysdon
and
other
answer
could
they
none
get
and
so
they
departed
Item
I
pray
you
send
hastily
word
how
that
you
will
that
we
be
guided
with
this
place
for
as
it
is
told
me
it
is
like
to
stand
in
as
great
jeopardy
in
haste
as
others
done

Yet
I
was
nothing
purposed
to
abide
here
when
I
come
from
home
but
for
a
day
or
two
but
I
shall
abide
here
till
I
hear
tidings
from
you
Item
my
mother
told
me
that
she
thinks
right
strange
that
she
may
not
have
the
profits
of
Clyre
his
place
in
peaceable
wise
for
you

She
said
it
is
hers
and
she
has
paid
most
therfore
yet
and
she
says
she
will
have
the
profits
thereof
or
else
she
will
make
more
folk
to
speak
thereof

She
says
she
knew
not
what
right
nor
title
that
you
have
therein
but
if
you
like
to
trouble
with
her
and
that
should
be
no
worship
to
you
and
she
says
she
will
be
there
this
summer
and
repair
the
housing
there

In
good
faith
I
hear
much
language
of
the
demeaning
between
you
and
her

I
would
right
fain
and
so
would
many
more
of
your
friends
that
it
were
otherwise
between
you
than
it
is
and
if
it
were
I
hope
you
should
have
the
better
speed
in
all
other
matters

I
pray
God
be
your
good
speed
in
all
your
matters
and
if
you
grace
to
have
a
good
conclusion
of
them
in
haste
for
this
is
too
worried
a
life
to
abide
for
you
and
all
yours

Written
in
haste
at
Haylysdon
the
10
day
of
May

The
cause
that
I
send
to
you
this
hastily
is
to
have
an
answer
in
haste
from
you

Right
worshipful
husband
I
recommend
me
to
you
praying
you
heartily
that
you
will
seek
a
means
that
your
servants
may
be
in
peace
for
they
are
daily
in
fear
of
their
lives

The
Duke
of
Suffolk's
men
threaten
daily
Dawbeney
Wykys
and
Richard
Calle
that
wheresoever
they
may
get
them
they
should
die
and
affrays
have
ben
made
on
Rychard
Calle
this
week
so
that
he
was
in
great
jeopardy
at
Norwich
among
them

And
great
affrays
have
been
made
upon
me
and
my
fellowship
here
on
Monday
last
past
of
which
Richard
Calle
tells
me
that
he
has
sent
you
word
of
in
writing
more
plainly
that
I
may
do
at
this
time
but
I
shall
inform
you
more
*fully
hereafter

I
suppose
there
shall
be
great
labour
against
you
and
your
servants
at
the
assises
and
sessions
here
wherefore
me
seems
saving
your
better
advice
it
were
well
done
that
you
should
speak
with
the
justices
or
they
come
here
and
if
you
will
that
I
complain
to
them
or
to
any
other
if
good
fortune
me
life
and
health
I
will
do
as
you
advise
me
to
do
for
in
good
faith
I
have
been
simply
entreated
among
them

And
what
with
sickness
and
trouble
that
I
have
had
I
am
brought
right
low
and
weak
but
to
my
power
I
will
do
as
I
can
or
may
in
your
matters

The
Duke
of
Suffolk
and
both
the
Duchesses
shall
come
to
Claxton
this
day
as
I
am
informed
and
this
next
week
he
shall
be
at
Cossey

Whether
he
will
come
further
hitherward
or
not
I
*know
not
yet

It
is
said
that
he
should
come
hither
and
yet
his
men
said
here
on
Monday
that
he
claimed
no
title
to
this
place

When
all
was
done
and
they
should
depart
Harlyston
and
other
desired
me
that
I
should
come
and
see
my
old
lady
and
show
to
my
lord
and
if
anything
were
amiss
it
should
be
amended

I
said
if
I
should
sue
for
any
remedy
that
I
should
sue
further
and
let
the
King
and
all
the
lords
of
this
land
to
have
knowledge
what
has
been
done
to
us
if
so
were
that
the
Duke
would
maintain
that
has
been
done
to
us
by
his
servants
if
you
would
give
me
leave

I
pray
you
send
me
word
if
you
will
that
I
make
any
complaint
to
the
Duke
or
the
Duchesse
for
as
it
is
told
me
they
know
not
the
*fullness
that
has
been
done
in
such
things
as
has
been
done
in
their
names

I
should
write
much
more
to
you
but
for
lack
of
leisure
The
Trinity
have
you
in
keeping

Written
the
Friday
next
after
Saint
Thomas

By
your
M.
P

RIGHT
worshipful
husband
I
recommend
me
to
you
desiring
heartily
to
hear
of
your
welfare
thanking
you
of
your
great
cheer
that
you
made
me
and
of
the
cost
that
you
did
on
me

You
did
more
cost
than
my
will
was
that
you
should
do
but
that
it
pleased
you
to
do
so
God
give
me
grace
to
do
that
may
please
you

And
I
and
Richard
informed
him
of
the
demeaning
of
his
undersheriff
how
partial
he
had
been
with
the
other
party
both
in
that
matter
and
also
for
the
actions
being
in
the
shire
and
he
was
nothing
well
pleased
of
the
demeaning
of
hys
undersheriff
and
he
had
written
to
him
that
he
should
be
indifferent
for
both
parties
according
to
the
law
both
for
that
matters
and
for
all
other

What
the
undersheriff
will
do
therein
I
know
never
for
he
is
not
yet
spoken
with

Item
as
for
Cotton
I
entered
into
the
place
as
on
Sunday
last
was
and
there
I
abode
till
on
Wednesday
last
past

I
have
left
there
John
Paston
the
younger
Wykes
and
other
12
men
for
to
receive
the
profits
of
the
manner
and
against
the
day
of
keeping
of
the
court
I
hope
there
shall
be
more
to
strengthen
them
if
it
needs

John
Paston
has
been
with
my
lord
of
Norfolk
since
we
entered
and
desired
his
good
lordship
to
strengthen
him
with
his
household
men
and
other
if
need
be
and
he
has
promised
he
would
do
so

And
I
sent
Richard
Calle
on
Tuesday
to
Knevett
desiring
him
that
he
would
send
to
his
bailiff
and
tenants
at
Mendlesham
that
they
should
be
ready
to
come
to
John
Paston
when
he
sent
for
them
and
he
sent
a
man
of
his
forthwith
charging
them
in
any
wise
that
they
should
do
so

And
he
sent
me
word
by
Richard
and
his
son
also
if
we
were
not
strong
enough
that
either
he
or
his
son
or
both
if
need
were
would
come
with
such
fellowship
as
they
could
get
about
them
and
that
they
would
do
as
faithfully
as
they
knew
for
you
both
in
that
matter
and
in
all
other
Item
I
received
a
letter
from
you
yesterday
whereof
I
thank
you
heartily
and
I
pray
you
that
I
may
be
as
you
wrote
Item
I
have
done
speech
for
your
worsted
but
you
may
not
have
it
till
Hallowmess
and
then
I
am
promised
you
shall
have
as
fine
as
may
be
made

Richard
Calle
shall
bring
it
up
with
him

And
they
say
they
will
carry
them
forth
to
Ey
prison
and
as
many
as
they
may
get
more
of
your
men
and
tenants
that
they
may
know
that
owe
you
good
will
or
has
been
to
you
ward
they
are
threatened
to
be
slain
or
imprisoned

on
Tuesday
at
10
of
clock
with
the
number
of
five
hundred
men
and
he
sent
after
the
mayor
and
alderman
with
the
sheriffs
desiring
him
in
the
King's
name
that
they
should
take
an
inquiry
of
the
constables
of
every
ward
within
the
city
what
men
should
have
gone
on
your
party
to
have
helped
or
succoured
your
men
at
any
time
of
these
gatherings
and
if
any
they
could
find
that
they
should
take
and
arrest
them
and
correct
them
and
also
certify
them
the
names
on
Wyndenesse
day
be
8
of
clock
which
the
mayor
did
and
will
do
anything
that
he
may
for
him
and
his

And
hereupon
the
mayor
has
arrested
one
that
was
with
me
called
Roberd
Lovegold
brazier
and
threatened
him
that
he
shall
be
hanged
by
the
neck
wherefore
I
would
that
there
might
come
down
a
writ
to
remove
him
if
you
think
it
be
to
do

He
was
not
with
me
not
save
that
Harleston
and
others
made
the
assault
upon
me
at
Lammesse
he
is
right
good
and
faithful
unto
you
and
therefore
I
would
he
had
help

I
have
no
man
at
this
time
to
await
upon
me
that
dare
be
avowed
but
Little
John

William
Nawton
is
here
with
me
but
he
dare
not
be
avowed
for
he
is
sore
threatened

It
is
told
me
the
old
lady
and
the
Duke
is
set
fervently
against
us
by
the
information
of
Harlesdon
the
bailiff
of
Cossey
and
Andrewys
and
Doget
the
bailiff's
son
and
such
other
false
shrews
the
which
would
have
this
matter
born
out
for
their
own
pleasure
the
which
causes
an
evil
noise
in
this
contry
and
other
places

And
as
for
Sir
John
Hevenyngham
Sir
John
Wyndefeld
and
other
worshipful
men
they
are
made
but
their
dogbolts
the
which
I
suppose
will
turn
them
to
disworship
hereafter

And
this
night
at
midnight
Thomas
Sleyforth
Grene
Portere
and
the
bailiff
of
Eye
and
others
had
a
cart
and
fetched
away
feather
beds
and
all
the
stuff
that
was
left
at
the
parson's
and
Thomas
Water's
house
to
be
kept
of
ours

I
shall
send
you
bills
hereafter
as
near
as
I
may
what
stuff
we
have
forborne

I
pray
you
send
me
word
how
you
will
that
I
be
demeaned
whether
you
will
that
I
abide
at
Caystere
or
come
to
you
to
London

I
have
no
leisure
to
write
no
more

God
have
you
in
his
keeping

Written
at
Norwich
on
Saint
Luke's
Evening

M.P

Address
To
my
right
worshipful
husband
John
Paston
be
this
delivered
in
haste

The
Duke
had
been
better
than
a
1000
pounds
that
it
had
never
been
done
and
you
have
the
more
good
will
of
the
people
that
it
is
so
foul
done

And
they
made
your
tenants
of
Haylesdon
and
Drayton
with
others
to
help
to
break
down
the
walls
of
the
place
and
the
log
both
God
knows
full
evil
against
their
wills
but
that
they
durst
no
other
conscience
do
for
fear

I
have
spoken
with
your
tenants
of
Haylesdon
and
Drayton
both
and
put
them
in
comfort
as
well
as
I
can

The
Duke
his
men
ransacked
the
church
and
bore
away
all
the
good
that
was
left
there
both
of
ours
and
of
the
tenants
and
left
not
so
much
but
that
they
stood
upon
the
high
altar
and
ransacked
the
images
and
took
away
such
as
they
might
find
and
put
away
the
parson
out
of
the
church
till
they
had
done
and
ransacked
every
man's
house
in
the
town
five
or
six
times

And
the
chief
masters
of
robbing
was
the
bailiff
of
Ey
the
bailiff
of
Stradbroke
Thomas
Slyford
and
Slyford
was
the
chief
robber
of
the
church
and
he
has
most
of
the
robbery
next
the
bailiff
of
Ey

And
as
for
lead
brass
pewter
iron
doors
gates
and
other
stuff
of
the
house
men
of
Coshay
and
Causton
have
it
and
that
they
might
not
carry
they
have
hewn
it
asunder
in
the
most
*despicable
wise

If
it
might
be
I
would
some
men
of
worship
might
be
sent
from
the
King
to
see
how
it
is
both
there
and
at
the
log
ere
than
any
snows
come
that
they
may
make
report
of
the
truth
else
it
shall
no
more
be
seen
so
plainly
as
it
may
now

And
at
the
reverence
of
God
speed
your
matters
now
for
it
is
too
horrible
a
cost
and
trouble
that
we
have
now
daily
and
must
have
till
it
be
otherwise
and
your
men
dare
not
go
about
to
gather
upon
your
livelihood
and
we
keep
here
daily
more
than
30
persons
for
salvation
of
us
and
the
place
for
in
very
truth
and
the
place
had
not
been
kept
strong
the
Duke
had
come
hither

It
is
thought
here
that
if
my
Lord
of
Norfolk
would
take
upon
him
for
you
and
that
he
may
have
a
commission
for
to
enquire
of
such
riots
and
robberies
as
has
been
done
to
you
and
others
in
this
country
that
then
all
the
country
will
await
upon
him
and
serve
your
intent
for
the
people
loves
and
dreads
him
more
then
any
other
lord
except
the
King
and
my
Lord
of
Warwyk
etc
And
I
pray
you
heartily
send
me
word
how
you
do
and
how
you
speed
in
your
matters
in
haste
and
that
I
may
have
knowledge
how
your
sons
does

I
come
home
this
night
late
and
shall
be
here
till
I
hear
other
tidings
from
you

Wykys
came
home
upon
Saturday
but
he
met
not
with
your
sons

God
have
you
in
his
keeping
and
send
us
good
tidings
from
you

Written
in
haste
upon
the
Saint
Simon
and
Jude
his
evening

By
yours
M.
P

Right
worshipful
and
my
singular
good
master
after
all
due
obedience
I
recommend
me
to
you
heartily
as
I
can
thanking
you
of
all
tenderness
showing
to
me
heretofore
beseeching
you
of
good
continuance
in
especial
at
the
conclusion
of
your
cause

I
trust
it
is
not
unknown
to
your
good
fatherhood
how
at
London
in
great
sickness
I
abode
six
weeks
to
your
grievous
costs
and
my
great
hindrance
and
heaviness

And
after
my
coming
to
the
court
I
made
due
scrutiny
of
the
state
of
your
cause
where
I
found
the
register
given
to
the
judge
and
the
cause
put
into
the
?rot
and
the
sentence
thrice
written

At
the
last
it
was
espied
we
had
not
sufficiently
proved
our
spectacle
wherefore
the
judge
nor
the
?rot
would
suffer
no
sentence
pass
without
we
would
prove
our
people
by
them
that
were
present
and
see
it

Wherefore
we
were
out
of
all
remedy
but
one
and
that
was
to
have
had
a
remission
to
certain
judges
and
to
have
brought
up
2
or
3
of
our
brothers
that
were
present
when
the
Prior
and
they
were
put
out
by
violence

This
would
have
been
grievous
costly
and
tedious
for
one
way
and
other
you
should
not
have
shaped
with
100
pound
but
thanked
be
God
suddenly
according
to
truth
and
conscience
and
right
we
found
2
men
that
has
testified
the
same
and
laid
the
remission
fatigation
and
grievous
costs
apart

And
within
short
days
we
trustfully
by
God's
grace
to
have
a
sentence
the
which
shall be
to
you
and
the
Monastery
the
greatest
worship
that
ever
you
had
in
your
days

In
this
somewhat
Peter
de
Mellinis
has
written
to
your
good
fatherhood

I
beseech
you
heartily
remember
M.
William
Clayton
for
by
his
means
and
succour
you
have
saved
great
goods
that
should
have
been
spent
had
his
help
not
been

He
will
be
with
you
within
few
months

worshipful

how
they

his

deposed
of

presence

which
is

Moreover
you
shall
receive
by
Mr
John
Norham

sent
from
him
a
certain
bull
with

the

he
is
worthy
great
thank
and
good
reward
as
he
has
deserved

I
shall
declare
more
largely
to
you
at
my
coming

God's
grace

of
the

And

Written
at
Exeter
the
27th
day
of
January

By
your
Cousin
Dame
Katherine
Arundell

To
my
right
worshipful
cousin
Thomas
Stonor
Esquire

IHS

Right
worshipful
and
my
most
singular
good
father
after
due
obedience
I
recommend
me
on
my
most
humble
wise
to
your
good
fatherhood

Your
advocate
called
your
adversaries
open
thieves
and
rebels
to
the
church
of
Rome
and
desired
that
they
should
defend
them
in
all
their
power
and
counsel
against
the
next
Consistory
where
he
would
openly
defend
the
cause
of
Saint
Cuthbert
whereupon
the
Scots
are
right
evil
I
pray
for
them
as
they
would
me
and
not
so
evil

What
time
I
came
last
to
Rome
I
would
I
had
been
buried
saving
the
defence
of
the
rights
of
Saint
Cuthbert's
house

God
help
me
as
I
will
the
weal
of
the
same

I
beseech
you
evermore
to
be
my
good
father
and
Almighty
send
me
good
word
once
of
your
good
fatherhood
and
our
brothers

Would
God
you
were
in
Consistorio
publico
in
the
proposing
of
Saint
Cuthbert's
commission
you
will
inspired
Master
James'
mind
in
the
making
thereof

More
I
would
have
written
but
the
time
gives
me
impediment

God
help
me
and
save
your
fatherhood

Ex
Roma
festinanter
primo
die
Julij
Anno
1472

Andreas
de
Sancta
Cruce
shall
reassume
our
commission
and
if
the
Scots
reply
Joachinus
shall
reply
again
their
replications
and
at
the
last
if
need
be
Andreas
de
Senes
shall
duplicate
his
replication
with
Andrew
de
Sancta
Cruce
and
Joachyn
and
so
this
will
be
one
of
the
solemn
acts
that
was
done
in
Rome
in
our
days

Wherefore
I
beseech
you
and
all
our
brothers
to
consider
this
for
it
is
no
feigned
thing

Andreas
de
Sancta
Cruce
is
more
glad
hereof
and
a
man
had
given
him
a
100
ducates
and
required
the
Scots
to
do
their
uttermost
and
take
the
best
counsel
they
could
have
in
Rome
wherefore
they
are
right
evil
paid
with
me
and
master
James

The
advocate
has
no
doubt
but
they
shall
obey
that
is
judged
in
despite
of
them
that
says
the
contrary

Within
few
days
by
God's
grace
you
shall
have
an
end
in
this
cause
the
which
has
been
full
grievous
to
your
fatherhood
but
it
shall be
by
God's
grace
to
you
a
perpetual
worship

Your
obligation
last
sent
to
me
is
here
of
no
effect
wherefore
had
not
Sir
Hew
Spaldyng
been
I
and
your
causes
had
been
utterly
undone

He
for
the
love
that
he
bears
me
till
his
hindrance
has
lent
me
the
money
upon
the
said
obligation
the
which
I
have
bound
to
him
in
poenis
Cameralibus
in
the
Bank
de
Spimoches
at
Rome

Wherefore
I
beseech
of
repayment
in
all
goodly
haste
and
to
consider
his
gentleness
and
my
great
needs
and
the
difficulty
of
the
causes
and
the
mightiness
of
our
enemies

Right
Reverent

Worshipful
and
entirely
best
beloved
Cousin
I
recommend
me
unto
you
in
the
most
lowliest
wise
that
I
best
can
or
may

And
sir
at
this
day
by
your
servant
Thomas
Mathew
I
received
a
letter
from
you
by
the
which
letter
I
understand
that
you
be
somewhat
amended
and
shall
every
day
better
and
better
than
other
by
the
grace
of
God

Also
gentle

I
understand
better
that
my
brother
and
yours
is
sore
sick
of
the
pox
wherefore
I
am
right
heavy
and
sorry
of
your
being
there
for
the
eggs
of
pox
is
full
contagious
and
namely
to
them
than
are
near
of
blood

Wherefore
I
would
pray
you
gentle
cousin
that
you
would
come
hither
and
if
it
would
please
you
so
to
do
etc.

And
if
that
it
like
you
not
so
to
do
Gentle
Cousin
let
me
have
hither
some
horses
I
pray
you
and
that
I
may
come
to
you
for
in
good
faith
I
can
find
it
in
my
heart
to
put
my
self
in
jeopardy
there
as
you
are
and
shall
do
whilst
my
life
endures
to
the
pleasure
of
God
and
yours

Wherefore
I
wished
full
heartily
diverse
times
that
you
had
been
here
for
I
*know
well
that
you
could
have
answered
in
certain
matters
better
than
I
for
truly
I
had
not
so
busy
a
week
since
I
came
hither
except
one
day
which
sir
William
and
John
Mathewe
both
can
inform
you
part
thereof

And
Sir
as
touching
my
children
I
heartily
thank
you
that
it
like
you
so
for
to
tend
them
but
yet
Gentle
Cousin
if
it
please
you
to
send
them
up
with
such
horses
as
it
likes
you
to
send
for
me
I
would
heartily
pray
you
for
the
pox
are
passed
out
of
this
country
and
city
as
far
as
I
understand
blessed
be
God

Gentle
Cousin
I
pray
you
heartily
that
I
may
have
a
ready
word
from
you
on
Saturday
at
night
at
the
farthest
for
in
truth
I
can
not
be
merry
unto
the
time
that
I
know
verily
how
that
you
will
I
be
demeaned
herein

No
more
to
you
at
this
time
but
almighty
Jesus
preserve
you
and
keep
you
long
in
good
health
of
body
and
long
to
live
in
virtue
to
God’s
pleasure
and

to
your
most
heart's
desire

heartily
as
he
can
or
may
and
besought
to
vouchsafe
to
pray
for
him
etc.
and
you
shall
receive
2
letters
of
him
by
John
Mathewe

And
at
this
day
8
of
the
clock
in
the
morning
he
took
his
barge

I
pray
God
send
him
good

By
your

Stonor

Right
entirely
and
best
beloved
Cousin
I
recommend
me
unto
you
in
most
loving
wise

Sir
I
received
from
you
a
letter
by
the
which
I
conceived
that
you
can
not
depart
but
it
should
be
to
your
great
loss

Wherefore
you
do
right
well
to
set
it
in
a
surete
for
it
is
no
little
money
that
he
owes
you

And
Sir
as
for
my
Cousin
Fowler
he
has
not
come
at
this
night
but
he
will
be
to
morrow
at
his
place
as
it
this
told
me

And
as
for
my
son
Betson
I
have
no
writing
since
you
depart

I
trust
it
shall
not
be
long
to
or
we
shall
have
writing
from
him

And
Sir
there
as
you
write
unto
me
there
as
that
Chetys
and
Hoderstone
should
be
left
there
still
truly
so
it
this
for
I
have
put
for
no
thing
save
only
for
certain
plot

furthermore
Sir
you
shall
understand
that
Thomas
a
Wode
is
very
sore
sick
at
the
Sword
in
Fleet
Street

And
Sir
I
thank
you
heartily
as
I
can
for
your
good
tenches
for
truly
they
were
very
good
and
sweet
as
I
had
any
many
a
day

Wherefore
I
sent
my
father
one
of
them
to
his
supper

Wherefore
he
thanks
you
right
heartily

No
more
unto
you
at
this
time
Jesus
have
you
in
his
keeping
Amen

October

Right
entirely
and
best
beloved
husband
I
recommend
me
unto
you
in
my
most
hearty
wise
evermore
thanking
you
right
heartily
of
all
kindness
to
me
showed
at
all
times
and
now
for
your
good
venison
and
coneys
the
which
you
sent
me
by
Hery
Blakhall
the
which
is
great
dainties
to
have
here
in
London
wherefore
I
sent
the
half
haunch
to
my
father
and
a
couple
of
coneys
and
they
recommend
them
unto
you
and
thank
you
right
heartily

And
sir
you
shall
understand
that
I
have
been
with
my
Lady
of
Southfolk
as
on
Thursday
last
was
and
waited
upon
her
to
my
lady
the
King's
Mother
and
hers
by
her
commandment

And
also
on
Saturday
last
was
I
waited
upon
her
thither
again
and
also
from
thence
she
waited
upon
my
lady
her
Mother
and
brought
her
to
Greenwich
to
the
King's
good
grace
and
the
?queen’s
and
there
I
saw
the
meeting
between
the
King
and
my
lady
his
mother

And
truly
me
thought
it
was
a
very
good
sight

And
sir
I
was
with
my
lady
of
Southfolke
at
this
day
hoping
that
I
might
have
had
her
at
some
leisure
that
I
might
have
spoken
to
her
for
the
money
but
truly
she
was
very
busy
to
make
her
ready
for
she
is
riding
to
Canterbury
at
this
same
day
and
she
will
be
here
again
as
on
Saturday
next
coming
for
so
she
told
me
herself

Also
Sir
I
spoke
with
my
cousin
Fowler
at
my
lady
the
King's
Mother
and
I
thanked
him
as
heartily
as
I
could
for
his
great
kindness
that
he
showed
to
you
and
to
me
at
all
times
praying
him
of
his
good
continuance
and
he
asked
me
when
you
would
come
hyther

And
I
told
him
that
I
supposed
that
you
would
be
here
at
this
week

And
also
I
spoke
with
my
cousin
Rokysse
and
he
asked
me
in
like
wise
and
he
says
it
is
not
his
fortune
to
meet
with
you
here
in
London
and
I
spoke
to
him
for
John
Mathews
matter
and
prayed
him
to
be
good
master
unto
him
and
he
answered
me
again
and
said
that
he
had
little
cause
for
he
says
that
he
*has
been
the
most
importune
man
that
might
be
to
himwards

And
she
says
with
out
they
are
otherwise
arrayed
she
says
she
may
not
keep
them
and
she
says
that
my
Mother
and
yours
should
say
that
you
have
enough
to
find
my
Sister
Elisabeth
with
all

Also
I
understand
that
Sir
John
Buttelyr
has
spoken
to
my
lady
to
have
my
Sister
Barantyne
with
him
what
he
means
therein
we
know
never
with
out
that
he
would
have
the
rule
of
her
husband's
livelihood
by
that
means

Wherefore
my
Sister
would
speak
with
you
for
that
matter
to
have
your
counsel
in
what
is
best
to
do

And
Sir
as
for
my
son
Betson
I
heard
no
word
from
him
since
you
departed
for
there
comes
no
passage
this
8
days

And
Sir
I
would
pray
you
when
Davy
Wrixame
comes
to
you
out
of
Cottswold
that
you
would
send
him
hither
that
he
might
write
to
my
son
how
he
have
done
in
the
country

And
good
Sir
I
pray
you
that
my
blue
gown
of
damask
may
be
sent
to
me
again
Allhallows
day
and
my
coffers
and
my
daughter
Catherine's
that
I
spoke
to
you
before

And
sir
such
kerchiefs
and
smocks
and
small
jupes
that
are
in
the
chest
that
Catherine
my
woman
had
role
of
which
chest
stands
in
my
son
Betson's
chamber

And
Sir
I
would
pray
you
that
you
would
send
this
gear
to
me
that
I
might
take
reckoning
of
her
for
she
*?shows
her
and
say
that
such
*clothing
as
I
ask
her
is
there

Yous
children
and
mine
fare
well
blessed
be
God
and
they
are
to
me
a
great
comfort
in
your
absence

No
more
to
you
at
this
time
but
almighty
Jesus
preserve
and
keep
you
in
long
health
and
virtue
to
his
pleasure

At
London
the
22
day
of
October

My
own
Cousin
I
send
you
a
bladder
with
powder
to
drink
when
you
go
to
bed
for
it
is
wholesome
for
you

By
your
own
to
my
poor
Elisabeth
Stonor

To
my
Right
well-beloved
Cousin
William
Stonor
squire
at
Stonor
this
be
delivered

25
October
1476
Right
entirely
and
best
beloved
Cousin
I
recommend
me
unto
you
as
heartily
as
I
can

Furthermore
Cousin
pleases
it
you
to
understand
that
I
have
received
a
boar
from
you
the
which
I
thank
you
right
heartily
therefor
the
which
boar
is
very
good
and
well
*fattened

And
so
Sir
I
pray
you
to
inform
my
mother
as
it
is
and
I
will
keep
the
goblet
unto
the
time
that
I
have
answer
from
her

Also
sir
I
pray
you
to
recommend
me
heartily
unto
her
good
motherhood

Furthermore
Cousin
I
long
sore
for
you
to
see
you
here
in
London
when
you
have
done
your
business
but
I
understand
that
you
have
had
great
business
since
you
departed
from
me

Sir
you
shall
understand
that
I
had
no
writing
from
my
son
Betson
for
as
near
as
I
can
encover
since
Howlake
departed
there
came
no
passage
from
Calais

Further
sir
I
pray
you
that
you
would
vouchsafe
for
to
see
John
Matthew
unto
Hendelay
for
to
break
the
*bundle
and
to
write
such
things
as
is
in
it
and
to
make
2
bundles
thereof
that
it
might
be
sent
down
by
the
carrier
of
Hendelay
for
I
can
not
have
it
against
the
time
else
for
I
must
needs
have
it
for
the
children
have
no
change
for
they
go
so
shamely
that
I
have
pity
of
them

And
good
Sir
as
for
my
own
gown
that
I
wrote
unto
you
of
I
pray
you
that
I
might
have
it
as
soon
as
you
may

No
more
unto
you
at
this
time
but
Jesus
have
you
in
his
keeping

Written
at
London
the
25
day
of
October

Jesu

1476

Right
entirely
and
best
beloved
husband
I
recommend
me
unto
you
in
my
most
heartiest
wise
that
I
best
can
or
may
certifying
you
that
I
have
received
your
letter
of
John
Stute
and
three
couple
of
conies
and
bald
rabbits
with
the
chick
the
which
I
thank
you
for
as
heartily
as
I
can

Also
I
conceive
by
your
writing
that
you
have
had
very
much
God
son
to
send
you
an
end
thereof
that
I
might
see
you
here

And
Sir
as
touching
the
hogshead
of
salt
that
you
wrote
to
me
for
truly
Sir
I
would
have
sent
it
to
you
with
all
my
heart
but
the
barges
were
departed
before
your
letter
came
unto
me

Also
Sir
I
have
received
since
you
departed
two
letters
from
my
son
Betson
as
on
Monday
last
was
one
of
them
directed
to
you

The
which
letters
I
have
read
and
well
understood
them

I
conceive
by
his
writing
that
he
is
very
loath
that
Elmys
will
depart
from
him
nevertheless
he
thinks
that
twenty-three
marks
and
a
di
price
for
to
buy
sixty
sacks
after
that
price
it
would
draw
much
money
and
little
getting
should
be
therein

And
so
I
to
defend
me

No
more
to
you
at
this
time
but
I
beseech
allmighty
Jesus
have
you
right
entirely
and
best
beloved
husband
in
his
blessed
keeping
ever
Amen

At
London
the
seventh
day
of
November

My
own
good
husband
I
see
well
you
remember
the
putting
at
out
of
the
bed
when
you
and
I
lay
last
together

By
your
own
to
my
power
Elisabeth
Stonor

To
my
right
worshipfull
husband
William
Stonor
Sqire
this
letter
be
delivered
in
haste

d.
d.
11
December
1476
Jesu
Right
entirely
and
best
beloved
husband
I
recommend
me
unto
you
in
the
most
loving
wise
that
I
best
can
or
may

Moreover
pleases
it
you
to
understand
that
I
have
received
your
letter
a
bill
closed
in
the
said
letter
which
I
have
read
and
right
well
understood
and
as
for
all
such
stuff
as
the
said
bill
specifies
of
as
yet
I
have
not
received

And
there
was
at
dinner
with
him
the
friends
of
the
child
which
was
moved
for
one
of
my
daughters
at
your
last
being
here

And
so
at
after
dinner
they
had
their
communication
for
the
said
matter
whereby
I
understand
their
dispositions
how
that
they
were
disposed
in
the
said
matter

And
truly
it
was
nothing
as
it
was
spoken
of
at
the
beginning
wherefore
I
answered
and
said
in
this
wise
that
though
she
were
my
child
as
she
is
I
could
not
answer
that
matter
without
you
nor
nought
would
do

How
be
it
I
answered
in
your
behalf
that
I
*knew
right
well
that
you
would
be
right
kind
and
loving
father
if
God
fortuned
that
you
and
they
should
deal

And
Sir
there
as
you
write
that
that
the
bargemen
are
loth
to
take
and
Receive
any
stuff
of
ours
I
marvel
greatly
for
truly
to
my
knowlege
I
had
never
thing
carried
by
any
of
them
but
that
I
paid
them
truly
therefore

And
Sir
as
for
the
6
couple
of
*cod
the
which
you
write
for
they
shall
be
bought
and
sent
to
you
right
shortly

And
as
for
your
gowns
of
chamlet
and
doublets
of
silk
I
have
bought
them
the
which
shall
please
you
right
well
I
trust
to
God
at
your
coming
etc.

And
Sir
my
son
Betson
recommends
him
unto
you
and
he
came
home
as
on
Monday
last
past
and
he
has
brought
with
him
blessed
be
God
good
tidings
the
which
he
and
I
shall
inform
you
at
your
coming

Amen

At
London
the
11
day
of
December
Anno
16
And
Cousin
hereas
you
write
to
me
that
I
had
no
leisure
truly
I
have
been
crised
and
busy
else
I
would
have
written
to
you
ere
this
time

By
your
own
Elisabeth
Stonor

To
my
Right
well
beloved
Cousin
William
Stonor
esquire
at
Stonor
this
be
delivered

Jesus
1476
I
greet
you
well
and
I
have
great
marvel
that
you
write
not
to
me
no
letters
of
such
tidings
as
you
have
at
Calais
the
which
is
much
speech
of
at
London
for
the
which
I
cannot
write
to
you
nothing
for
lack
of
understanding
how
it
stand
in
the
parties
of
the
Duke
of
Borgen's
land
and
the
King
of
France
for
here
is
strange
speaking
for
the
which
I
pray
they
be
wise
and
be
not
over-haste
in
sale
and
delivering
of
good
into
Flanders
for
I
fear
me
sore
of
war
and
the
Duke
be
dead
as
it
is
said
and
the
King
of
France
entered
into
Picardy
as
men
say
for
the
which
I
pray
you
so
will
too

And
also
say
to
Thomas
Kesten
that
he
promised
to
me
that
the
10
s
of
sarplier
shall
be
paid
to
John
Tate
the
which
is
not
paid
for
the
which
I
have
great
calling
for
the
payment
there
and
Wyll
Maryon
and
Robard
Cely
for
their
part
for
the
which
I
am
not
well
pleased
with
Kesten
for
that
matter
wherefore
write
me
answer
what
he
says
and
also
what
appointment
made
with
Byfylde
and
all
other
men
there
as
he
is
entreated
to
and
say
to
Thomas
Kesten
I
trust
to
him
that
he
will
have
in
remembrance
his
promise
made
to
me
when
I
delivered
him
plat
that
I
shall
be
pleased
with
some
payment
of
him
with
other
men

And
he
will
do
so
I
shall
be
his
good
friend
and
that
he
shall
well
understand
in
time
to
come
for
the
which
I
will
be
glad
for
to
do
for
him
and
Will
himself

I
write
no
more
to
you
at
this
time
but
Jesus
keep
you

Anno

Right
entirely
and
best
beloved
husband
I
recommend
me
unto
you
as
heartily
as
I
can

Sir
I
have
received
a
letter
from
you
and
an
other
letter
that
my
son
Betson
sent
you
and
a
token
from
you
by
your
servant
Christopher
which
letter
I
have
read
and
right
well
understood

And
as
touching
John
Elmys
truly
sir
he
is
a
marvelous
man
I
conceive
by
my
son
that
he
would
go
from
his
promise
that
he
made
to
you
and
to
him
of
his
will
that
it
should
arise
as
good
in
pokyng
this
year
as
it
did
the
last
year
and
that
I
conceive
he
cannot
make
good
but
nevertheless
I
doubt
not
but
that
you
and
my
son
Betson
will
handle
the
matters
well
enough
for
blessed
be
God
you
be
on
the
surer
side
for
all
the
said
will
I
have
received
it
and
fair
housed
it
and
it
for
all
that
I
wit
well
that
you
and
my
son
will
not
deal
with
him
otherwise
than
right
and
conscience
will
require
and
that
is
best

Sir
I
thank
you
heartily
that
it
pleased
you
to
wish
me
with
you
at
reading
of
my
letter
truly
I
would
I
had
a
been
there
with
you
at
the
same
season
with
all
my
heart

And
as
touching
my
brother
Stonor
truly
sir
there
was
nobody
that
told
me
precisely
that
it
was
he
but
I
know
well
it
was
he
for
it
was
said
to
me
that
I
kept
you
here
among
a
meinie
of
boys
with
other
language
more
which
was
not
fitting
for
to
have
such
language
of
any
servant
that
belong
to
you
or
me
for
and
he
remember
himself
well
he
has
no
cause
to
say
of
me
otherwise
than
well
for
I
never
said
to
displease
him
by
my
will
but
for
his
own
worship
and
that
knows
God
who
ever
preserve
you

At
London
the

Jesus

I
greet
you
well
and
I
understand
there
come
no
merchants
to
Calais
for
to
buy
wool
nor
fur
for
the
which
is
right
heaviness
for
the
merchants
of
the
staple
for
the
which
I
fear
me
every
man
will
find
the
means
for
the
sale
and
deliver
his
wool
and
fur
into
sure
man
his
hands
by
the
means
of
sale
to
merchants
strangers
the
which
have
repaired
to
Calais
afore
this
time
for
the
which
I
would
you
had
communication
with
such
merchants
as
you
have
found
sure
men
and
good
men
for
to
adventure
some
of
my
wool
and
fur
in
their
hands
by
the
means
of
sale
at
long
days
for
I
feel
man
shall
do
so
at
this
season
for
the
which
I
would
think
that
John
Underhaye
were
a
good
man
for
to
trust
and
other
men
such
as
you
think
good
men

Spare
not
for
a
long
day

will
there
be
divers
men
of
the
fellowship
of
the
Staple
of
Calais

sold
wool

at
London
for
the
which
I
am
advised
for
to
ship
my
wool
and
fur
at
this
time
for
the
which
keep
money
for
the
freight
and
custom
and
subsidy

There
was
1
pound
lent
beforehand
and
my
partition
of
4
shillings
the
pound
shall
help
too

And
yet
I
may
do
no
more
good
neither
in
buying
of
wool
nor
furs
nor
in
building
for
defeat
and
lack
of
money
for
the
which
I
shall
think
long
till
Bamys
market
come

Written
later
At
this
day
I
have
shipped
10
sarpliers
wool
and
daily
do
ship
God
send
them
well
to
Calais
and
save
for
it
is
likely
to
be
a
great
shipping
of
wool
and
fur
at
London

I
write
no
more
but
Jesus
keep
you

I
write
to
you
shortly
and
in
great
haste
and
also
in
good
faith
for
lack
of

I
forgo
many
good
bargains
of

the

I

Right
best
and
heartily
well
beloved

I
recommend
me
unto
you
with
all
my
heart
letting
you
wit
that
I
am
right
well
amended
I
thank
God
thereof
and
on
Sunday
last
past
I
was
at
the
church
at
my
father’s
dirge
and
souped
with
my
mother
the
same
night

And
also
I
pray
you
to
remember
my
son
Betson
for
he
has
much
ado
do
with
money
now
and
he
trusts
verily
to
your
promise
for
God’s
sake
sir
let
him
not
be
forgotten

My
mother
and
my
brother
Stooker
recommend
them
both
right
heartily
unto
you
and
full
fain
they
would
that
you
had
been
here
if
it
might
have
been
your
ease

And
as
for
me
I
would
not
that
you
were
here
you
know
it
well
enough
nevertheless
for
sooth
what
some
ever
I
write
I
would
I
were
at
Stonor
for
truly
I
am
very
weary
of
London
for
my
son
Betson
intends
to
ride
into
the
country
now
when
I
come
home
and
he
is
fast
rigging
him
therefore
so
that
at
many
times
I
am
post
alone
and
that
causes
me
to
think
the
more
ellynger
and
therefore
good
sir
remember
mine
horse
on
Saturday
without
fault

My
son
Betson
and
his
wife
recommend
them
unto
you
and
he
told
me
that
he
has
bought
here
in
London
sith
you
departed
five
sacks
cots

For
a
part
ready
money
and
the
rest
at
midsummer
next
I
understand
it
is
a
good
bargain

God
lend
grace
who
preserve
you
ever
in
virtue
and
long
health

God’s
pleasure

The
5
day
of
October

By
your
own
wife
Dame
Elisabeth
Stonor

Brother
Robert
I
recommend
me
unto
you
it
is
so
that
Buldry
has
two
writs
against
you
in
Berkshire
of
a
great
sum
and
so
I
communed
with
Farendon
his
attourney
therein
and
that
I
marvel
that
he
would
lay
the
actions
in
that
shire
etc.

The
cause
I
understand
well
to
put
you
to
bill
by
Cepi
corpus
or
else
an
utlary
which
will
have
stand
you
in
great
charge

Nevertheless
I
have
appeared
for
you
before
the
m
tyll
you
may
otherwise
deal
therein
for
your
avail
and
upon
the
continuance
of
the
same
to
make
good
end
between
you
for
Farendon
feared
that
his
master
had
given
him
a
great
charge
to
hasten
the
process
as
fast
as
he
might

How
be
it
he
was
right
loath
if
he
might
otherwise
do
it

When
you
come
to
London
I
shall
give
you
my
advice
or
else
you
send
word
of
this
so
it
shall be
demeaned
and
a
direction
taken
therein
with
God's
grace
to
your
pleasure
who
keep
you

I
pray
you
recommend
me
to
my
and
his
wife

From
London
the
Whitsun
evening
etc.

Your
lover
H.
Hautmont

Days
be
coming
for
the
which
I
am
well
pleased
the
merchants
be
good

Also
I
understand
your
being
at
Bamyse
market
and
the
giving
of
money
by
exchange
8
shillings
8
pence
Florin
for
6
shillings
8
pence
sterling
the
which
is
great
loss

I
have
received
of
Will
Maryon
the
bringer
of
the
letters
a
box
therein
9
letters
of
payment
according
to
your
writing

Also
I
wrote
to
you
in
my
last
writing
of
the
money
saying
of
in
Flemders
I
heard
of
no
labour
at
that
time
but
it
is
known
the
Mayor
of
the
Staple
and
the
fellowship
of
merchants
make
great
suit
to
the
lords
of
the
King's
Council
of
the
which
is
likely
to
be
a
conclusion
and
that
matter
shall
be
reformed
as
I
understand
to
more
profit
for
the
Staple
for
the
which
keep
no
money
by
you
for
there
will
be
much
loss
to
them
that
have
much
money
in
their
hands

I
pray
you
beware
of
loss
for
I
understand
well
there
will
be
great
loss

Also
I
have
paid
my
bill
of
16
shillings
8
pence
the
sarplier
-
47
pounds
18
shillings
4
pence
-
and
your
bill
-
4
pounds
15
shillings
10
pence
-
and
Will
Maryon's
bill
-
9
pounds
7
shillings
6
pence
I
understand
that
I
shall
have
another
bill
in
ducat
of
my
custom
at
Calais
for
the
which
I
would
understand
before
the
coming
of
the
sum
that
I
make
the
said
money
ready
for
I
love
not
the
sharp
calling
on
at
London
for
I
understood
not
2
days
before
I
paid
the
bill
of
16
shillings
8
pence
to
John
Tate

I
am
not
paid
of
John
Raynold
at
the
day
nor
a
month
after
this
bill

send
to
me
as
soon
as
you
may
clear
my
bill
of
custom
and
paid
them
shortly
I
will
understand
the
clearness
of
my
dealing
and
clear
my
book

I
was
the
first
that
realised
my
action
and
delivered
the
good
the
which
I
had
in
ward
to
himself

Other
men
were
content
by
agreement
agreed
and
set
in
a
way
but
I
am
not
spoken
with
nor
entreat
like
the
promise
made
to
me
at
that
time
by
Thomas
Kesten
for
the
which
and
Thomas
Kesten
will
set
me
in
worse
case
of
assurete
nor
be
done
to other
men
he
keep
not
his
faithful
promise

I
hear
much
thing
said
by
him
for
the
which
and
I
were
entreat
for
assurete
of
a
comfort
of
payment
I
could
do
and
say
for
him
the
which
would
be
for
his
profit
and
worship

I
understand
that
will
be
diverse
men
that
I
speak
with
and
spare
of
me
the
guiding
and
the
disposition
of
Thomas
Kesten
for
the
which
I
will/want
you
read
all
this
clase
to
him

It
be
for
his
worship
to
remember
this
matter

I
write
no
more
to
you
at
this
time
Jesus
have
you
in
keeping

Written
at
London
the
6
day
of
November
in
great
haste

by

Cely

And
if
you
will
speed
you
home
to
speak
with
him
at
his
coming
I
doubt
not
but
you
shall
have
the
one
at
the
least
for
I
understand
they
be
not
wards/guards
neither
to
the
king
nor
queen
praying
you
therefore
to
speed
you
home
for

he
will be

Bryan
tonight
or
tomorrow
without
fail

Also
for
all
such
stewardships
you
wrote
unto
me
for
they
were
granted
away
in
his
lifetime
or

As
for
the

of

Sir
I
thank
you
heartily
for
your
venison
that
you
wrote
to
me
to

all
my
heart
desiring
greatly
to
hear
of
your
amendment
and
good

Informing
you
at
the

be
God

desire
greatly
to
hear
of

Sir
we
marvel
greatly
that
we
have
no
writing
from
you

Since
William
Cely
departed
we
had
no
letter
from
him
but
one
and
that
was
written
at
Calais
heuer
has
come
at
you

Sir
here
is
Philip
Sellar's
factors
come

That
one
has
wedded
Philip's
daughter
his
name
is
John
Forner
and
the
other’s
name
is
Herry
Demorres

By
the
means
of
a
broker
whose
name
is
John
Jacope
a
Lombar
who
bore
them
on
hand
at
the
bill
was
proudest
and
our
father
put
the
matter
in
John
Jakopy's
hand
and
he
has
laboured
for
payment
and
the
8
day
of
this
present
month
of
December
I
received
300
crowny
the
which
are
chosen
by
the
broker
out
of
one
400
every
crown
4
shillings
The
King
paid
them
every
crown
at
4
shillings
6
pence
The
broker
has
awarded
that
I
shall
ride
to
our
father
into
Essex
and
bring
a
letter
of
his
hand
to
them
directed
to
you
that
you
may
deliver
them
the
fardel
with
arras
that
Philip
Sellar
left
with
you
and
I
shall
have
5
pounds
for
the
proudest
and
all
other
costs
but
the
broker's
part
will
be
much
etc.

I
pray
you

God
that
we

Right

I

such

as
I

or
may
thanking
you
of

shown
unto
me
so
poor
a
woman
as
I
am
and
unto
your
mastership
undeserved
desiring
to
hear
of
your
welfare
the
which
I
pray
almighty
God
to
preserve
you
to
your
most
pleasure
and
heart’s
desire

Please
you
to
have
enknowliche
of
my
poor
welfare
at
the
making
of
this
my
letter
I
was
in
good
health
and
I
trust
in
God
within
short
space
to
be
better
for
now
I
am
at
my
liberty
whereof
I
thank
you
in
my
own
house
at
Exeter

The
physician
will
do
his
cunning
upon
me
but
undertake
me
he
will
not
nor
never
did
none
in
his
life

Comfort
in
him
I
find
and
in
my
mind
I
think
he
will
do
me
good

Me
thinks
a
thousand
years
gone
that
I
heard
any
tidings
from
you

And
in
good
faith
you
may
say
unto
me
that
I
am
unkind
that
I
wrote
nor
sent
unto
you
since
your
last
being
at
Wideslade

The
cause
is
for
mine
excuse
is
I
have
be
in
hell
where
I
had
little
comfort
but
as
soon
as
I
came
to
Exeter
then
was
I
in
heaven
and
because
that
I
am
now
in
joy
I
do
send
you
this
letter

Master
it
is
so
that
the
physician
is
in
hands
with
me
and
he
desires
to
have
me
in
cure
three
months
for
which
cause
I
pray
you
remember
your
worship
and
my
poor
quest

And
as
I
amend
I
shall
put
you
in
knowledge
by
the
grace
of
Jesus
who
keep

he
has
given
her
over

he
purposed
to
absent
himself
and
come
to
Calais
shortly
and
as
for
John
Rawn's
matter
I
have
spoken
with
the
King's
boucher
and
he
says
he
has
sent
the
signet
to
Calais

here
has
been
Leonard
Boys

Bawll
is
in

plight
he
mourned

him
a

Anno
Jesu
1480
Right
entirely
wellbeloved
brother
I
recommend
me
unto
you
as
lovingly
as
heart
can
think
informing
you
at
the
making
of
this
our
father
mother
and
we
all
are
in
good
hail
thanked
be
God
and
the
26
day
of
this
month
I
received
2
letters
from
you
one
to
our
father
another
to
myself
the
which
I
do
well
understand
and
here
I
send
you
closed
in
this
a
bill
of
master
Richard's
hand
from
the
Mayor
of
the
Staple
for
the
discharge
of
the
23
shillings
4
pence
of
the
sarplier
for
17
sarpliers
19
pounds
16
shillings
8
pence
And
I
feel
by
your
letter
that
the
wool
shipped
at
your
departing
from
hence
was
not
so
good
as
I
would
it
had
been

Our
father
was
at
the
packing
thereof
himself

I
trust
to
God
this
wool
shall
please
you
better
and
as
for
middle
wool
you
have
all
that
belongs
to
that
sort

My
lord
recommends
him
to
you
and
looks
daily
for
the
gear
that
you
promised
to
purvey
him
and
Gladman
praise
you
to
purvey
a
saddle
for
him
somewhat
less
than
my
Lord's
shall
be

I
live
still
at
Berwyke
and
I
think
will
do
all
this
summer

Sir
I
have
received
at
the
day
well
and
truly
the
4
pounds
sterling
of
our
brother
Robarde

And
now
the
ship
hire
but
our
father
proposes
not
to
ship
till
it
be
near
Michaelmas
and
therefore
we
will
look
for
you
daily
and
sir
I
pray
you
bring
with
you
and
the
reckoning
that
I
am
indebted
to
you
and
we
shall
see
a
way
therein
by
the
grace
of
Jesus
keep
you
and
bring
you
into
England
soon
and
in
safety

Sir
our

I

has
received
no
writing
from

since
Addlynton
was

wherof
I
marvel
for
I
wrote
2
letters
to
you
while
I
was
at
Bruges
specifying
of

have

I

I

I

as
for
your
black
box
I
leave
it
with
Thomas
Graunger

Sir
as
for
going
into
Flanders
is
good
enough
as
yet
but
all
the
jeopardy
is
in
coming
home
for
and
if
our
men
of
war
take
their
fisher
as
I
fear
they
will
there
will
be
many
Englishmen
stopped
in
Flanders
and
also
the
town
of
Dunkirk
is
not
content
and
that
we
shall
well
know
if
so
be
that
they
meet
with
any
merchants
of
substance

And
Sir
as
for

for

has
been
at
Calais
diverse
times
since
I
was
entered
your
attorney
wherefore
your
presence
has
defeated
that
entire
and
a
letter
of
attorney
is
needfull
now
at
this
time

Further
please
it
your

with
Englishmen's
goods
now
arrested
at
Ostend
and
at
other
diverse

no
ways
for
Englishmen
has
taken
many
of

many
as

singular
safeconducts
their
goods
shall
be
delivered
and
let
pass
through
but
as
for
the
general
they
will
not
obey
for
they
annull
it
saying
that
the
English
ships
forfeited
it
when
they
departed
out
of
Sealand
they
being
under
arest

Item

as
for

9
pounds
10 shillings
and
yet
non
to
get
in
regard
but
there
is
wrack
enough
and
9
pounds
the
last

And
so
there
is

Williamson
wherein
I

8
pounds
and
the
rawn
9
pounds
the
which
I
trust
to
God
shall
come
full
well
to
Calais
for
Sir
Jamus
Tyrrell
has
goods
in
the

that
I
am
come
to
Calais
in
safety
thanked
be
almighty
God
for
I
was
never
in
so
great
jeopardy
coming
out
of
Flanders
in
my
life
for
men
a
war
lying
by
the
way
waiting
for
Englishmen
and
also
I
and
my
company
was
arrested
2
days
at
Dunkirk
but
for
Sir
James
Tyrrell's
sake
we
were
let
go

And
so
sir
the
world
goes
marvellously
in
Flanders
now
for
it
is
open
war
between
Gaunt
and
the
King
of
Romayns
etc.

Sir
as
for
making
over
of
your

since
this
trouble
began
I
could
not

a
penny
savyng
an
48
pound
sterling
whereof
I
shall
send
you
the

at
the
next
passage

But
sir
John
Delowppis
showed
me
at

departing
that
I
should
write
unto
your
masterships
to
understand
whether
there
shall
be
any
jeopardy
to
bring
wars
out
of
the
East
parties
into
England
now
from
henceforth
or
not
as
he
supposes
that
that
act
of
the
contrary
shall
be
put
in
suspense
for
diverse
causes
wherefore
sir
he
advises
you
to
bestow
your
money
in
gross
wares
now
betimes

such
wares
as
your

thinks
will
be
best
at
London
whether
it
is
in
madder
wax
or
fustians
but
I
trow
madder
is
best

And
so
be
that
you
will
Gomers
De
Sore
shall
buy
it
for
your
masterships
and
shipped
it

for
John
Delowppis
and
he
are
purposed
to
buy
much
madder
to
send
into
England

And
if
so
be
that
it
falls
to
peace
there
will
be
good
done
upon
madder
if
it
is
bought
betimes
and
John
Delowppis
says
if
your
masterships
will
he
will
bestow
your
money
as
well
as
his
own
and
he
says
that
that
is
the
best
ways
to
make
over
your
money

the
exchange

as
you
have
for
I
know
those
persons
that
have
been
set
to
murder
you
and
by
whose
cause
and
means
they
so
did

My
master
asked
him
what
they
were
he
would
then
show
him
but
said
that
he
would
show
him
more
of
that
matter
at
another
time
when
we
shall
have
more
leisure

So
for
what
he
said
now
am
I
and
master
porter
as far
into
the
dance
as
you
are
for
I
promise
you
of
my
faith
that
all
those
that
are
and
were
proffered
hither
into
their
rooms
by
my
Lord
Chamberlain
shall
never
love
none
of
us
and
especially
those
that
were
his
household
servants
before

The
cause
why
they
so
do
I
cannot
tell
but
for
that
we
follow
the
King's
pleasure
and
so
will do

Therefore
good
it
is
that
we
see
to
our
own
surety
as well
as
for
the
surety
of
this
the
King's
town
that
it
may
be
sure
to
him
and
his
what
world
so
ever
shall
happen
to
fall
here
after
to
have
in
remembrance
that
the
greater
and
more
part
of
those
that
are
in
the
King's
retinue
here
are
of
my
Lord's
preferment

Also
look
how
strong
he
is
in
the
King's
court
of
his
household
servants
for
the
more
part
of
his
guard
are
of
those
that
were
my
Lord
Chamberlain's
servants
before

And
hard
it
is
to
know
men's
minds
if
God
should
send
a
sudden
change
as
he
has
here
before

Then
said
my
master
your
deputy
that
"
I
dare
receive
the
sacrament
that
my
Lord
is
as
true
to
the
King's
grace
as
any
man
living
and
in
like
wise
said
master
porter

Item
the
same
Sir
Hughe
said
that
"
we
be
here
now
together
the
King's
true
servants
to
live
and
die
and
also
to
spend
all
that
we
have
in
the
world
to
do
his
grace
service

Therefore
what
so
ever
we
speak
or
common
for
his
surety
and
for
the
surety
of
this
his
town
can be
no
treason
so
good
it
is
that
we
look
and
speak
of
things
to
come
as
well
as
those
present

I
do
speak
this
for
a
cause
that
is
good
that
we
look
sadly
to
for
the
King's
grace
is
but
a
weak
man
and
sickly
not
likely
to
be
no
long
life’s
man

It
is
not
long
since
his
Highness
was
sick
and
lay
then
in
his
manner
in
Wangsted

It
happened
the
same
time
me
to
be
among
many
great
personages
the
which
feel
in
communication
of
the
King's
grace
and
of
the
world
that
should
be
after
him
if
his
grace
happened
to
depart

Then
he
said
that
some
of
them
spoke
of
my
Lord
of
Buckingham
saying
that
he
was
a
noble
man
and
would
be
a
real
ruler

Other
there
were
that
spoke
he
said
in
likewise
of
your
traitor
Edmond
De
la
Pole
but
none
of
them
he
said
that
spoke
of
my
Lord
prince

Then
said
master
porter
to
him
"
Have
you
never
broken
to
the
King's
grace
of
this
matter

Of
my
faith
in
like
wise
since
my
coming
I
have
showed
the
same
to
Sir
Nicholas
Voux
lieutenant
of
Gysnes
and
to
Sir
Anthony
Brown
lieutenant
of
the
castle
here
and
they
answered
me
both
this
that
they
had
two
good
holds
to
resort
unto
the
which
they
said
should
be
sure
to
make
their
pace
how
so
ever
the
world
turns

Then
my
master
your
deputy
and
master
porter
both
said
to
him
that
he
could
no
let
do
but
show
these
matters
unto
your
Highness

He
said
that
"
It
were
good
that
the
King’s
grace
knew
these
sayings
but
as yet
I
have
not
showed
him
no
part
hereof
neither
never
I
will do

Then
said
master
porter
to
him
angrily
and
swore
by
God's
precious
soul
he
be
the
more
to
blame
to
keep
such
matters
from
his
Highness
and
in
like
wise
said
my
master
your
deputy
and
all
we
being
there

Item
after
many
words
spoken
touching
the
same
Sir
Hughe
Conway
said
"
If
you
knew
King
Harry
our
master
as
I
do
you
would
be
aware
how
that
you
broke
to
him
in
only
such
matters
for
he
would
take
it
to
be
said
but
of
envy
ill
will
and
malice

Then
should
anyone
have
blame
and
no
thank
for
his
truth
and
good
mind
and
that
have
I
well
proved
here
to
fore
in
like
causes
for
that
time
that
the
Lord
Lovell
lay
in
Colchester
a
trusty
friend
of
mine
came
to
me
and
showed
me
in
council
the
day
and
time
of
his
departing
and
of
all
his
purpose

I
was
sworn
to
him
that
I
should
never
utter
this
to
man
living
to
his
hurt
but
yet
forthwith
afterwards
because
of
my
allegiance
I
came
to
Sir
Raynold
Bray
and
showed
him
all
as
is
above
and
forthwith
he
said
that
Master
Bray
showed
the
same
unto
the
King’s

Whereupon
I
was
brought
before
his
Highness
and
I
affirmed
all
to
be
true
as
my
said
friend
had
showed
and
the
King
said
that
it
could
not
be
so
and
reasoned
with
me
always
to
the
contrary
of
my
said
sayings

I
shall
no
more
tempt
him
while
I
live
in
such
causes

Then
said
master
porter
"
I
think
that
you
dare
never
speak
these
words
to
the
King’s
grace
as
you
have
rehearsed
them
now
here
and
he
swore
my
great
oath
that
he
did

Item
my
master
your
deputy
said
that
"
I
know well
that
the
King’s
Highness
is
hard
of
credence
in
such
matters
and
that
know
you
he
said
"
master
porter
as well
as
I
for
how
long
was
it
ere
his
grace
and
his
council
would
believe
one
thing
of
untruth
to
be
in
Sir
James
Tyrell
and
some
said
I
did
seek
to
do
him
hurt
for
malice

"
Item
another
time
I
did
write
unto
his
Highness
that
one
had
showed
me
that
Sir
Robert
Clyfford
should
say
here
in
his
town
to
a
lady
that
Perken
Warbeke
was
King
Edward’s
son

Never
words
went
colder
to
my
heart
then
they
did

His
Highness
sent
me
sharp
writing
again
that
he
would
have
the
proof
of
this
matter

I
had
no
witness
then
but
my
self
but
as
it
happened
afterwards
I
caused
him
by
good
craft
to
confess
the
same
he
had
said
to
me
before
him
that
was
marshall
here
at
that
time
and
else
I
had
likely
to
be
put
to
a
great
plunge
for
my
truth

At
the
last
all
thought
that
it
was
not
to
show
this
to
your
grace
without
better
proof
yet
master
porter
said
it
was
great
pity
that
the
King
did
not
trust
his
true
knights
better
and
to
give
them
credence
in
such
things
as
they
should
show
for
his
surety
for
great
hurt
may
come
by
that
man

he
said
"
was
but
22nd
year
and
little
more

Then
said
my
master
your
deputy
"
I
beshrew
his
heart
that
so
did
write
and
also
I
pray
God
send
all
them
that
think
the
same
to
be
true
a
short
shameful
death

The
treasurer
said
again
"
We
may
not
be
angry
in
this
matters
when
we
shall
common
for
the
surety
of
our
selves
as well
as
of
this
the
King’s
town
for
I
think
not
verily
thus
to
be
all
true
that
I
have
said
but
I
know well
that
every
man
is
mortal
and
must
die
and
that
that
I
have
said
I
shall
show
you
my
book
that
shall
declare
you
the
same
plainly
to
be
as
I
have
said
and
spoken

Master
porter
said
"
Then
I
pray
you
master
treasurer
bring
that
book
and
a
vengeance
take
the
first
writer

Item
then
said
my
master
your
deputy
to
master
Convay
"
I
pray
you
leave
this
prophecy
of
the
King
for
you
speak
of
things
that
I
never
keep
never
hear
nor
see
and
that
my
prayer
is
that
I
never
leave
day
another
hour
longer
than
the
King’s
grace
and
his
children
shall
have
and
enjoy
the
realm
of
England

And
likewise
spoke
master
porter
and
we
all
being
there

Item
then
said
master
Conway
"
All
this
that
I
have
spoken
is
to
the intent
to
have
all
things
to
be
made
sure
for
the
King
and
his
children
and
especially
this
his
town
of
Calais
and
that
can
never
be
done
without
good
and
wise
communication
had
of
the
same
before

I
tell
you
for
surety
that
that
shall
never
be
as long
as
the
lady
Luse
shall be
in
the
castle
that
we
can
assure
the
King
of
this
his
town
for
the
castle

the
key
of
this
town

a
contrary

night

I
know
masters
he
said
"
what
longs
to
such
matters
better
than
you

therefore
I
pray
you
suffer
me

spoke

What
he
said

her

porter

your
grace
examine
him
can
show
your
Highness
better
than
I
can
do

Also
he
said
"
Remember
all
the
company

the
King's

ill
mind

most

Item
Raynold
of
the
Chambre
a
constable
of
the
retinue
with
other

"
These
men
he
said
"
never
loved
the
King’s
grace
nor
never
would do
with
many
more
of
the
same
mind
within
this
town

Now
I
have
showed
all
the
worst

This
be
a
shrewd
company
set
in
ill
mind

you
not

this
will
fail
indeed

good
provision
be
made
for
the
remedy
in
time

So
I
trust
that
we
shall
always
keep
the
town

to
the
King’s
use

More
of
this
touching
this
last
article
was
spoken
which
is
not
now
perfectly
in
my
remembrance
but
well
I
remember
that
every
man
named
one
to
rid
the
world
of
if
such
danger
should
come
to

your
prosperity
and
welfare
and
good
speed
in
your
matters
the
which
I
marvel
greatly
that
I
have
no
word
from
you

Sir
I
marvel
greatly
that
you
let
the
matter
rest
so
long
and
labours
no
better
for
your
self
and
you
would
labour
it
diligently

But
it
is
said
that
you
be
less
forward
and
they
underwork
falsely
and
it
is
seen
and
known
by
them
for
they
think
to
drive
that
they
may
take
the
Whitsunday
farm
and
so
it
is
said
all
the
country
about

And
the
other
tenants
cannot
pays
their
houses
but
they
shall be
caged
and
also
willing
none
of
your
servants
shall
not
pass
the
dowers
but
they
must not
be
troubled

And
also
they
have
stopped
the
country
that
there
will
no
man
deal
with
any
of
your
servants
neither
to
buy
wood
no
nor
nothing
else

Therefore
I
pray
you
that
you
will
get
some
commendment
to
the
Sheriff
that
the
process
may
be
stopped

Also
Sir
I
send
you
the
copy
of
the
letter
that
came
from
the
Undersheriff
and
the
copy
of
the
causes
and
the
letter
that
come
from
William
Ellison
the
which
I
had
mind
in
for
loosing
of
Edmund
Ward
for
I
have
gotten
him
forth
by
the
ways
of
William
Ellyson

And
also
Sir
I
am
in
good
health
and
all
the
children
(
blessed
be
Jesus
and
all
your
children
praise
you
for
your
daily
blessing

And
all
your
servants
is
in
good
health
and
prays
diligently
for
your
good
speed
in
your
matters

And
also
it
is
said
that
they
have
cagements
for
them
that
has
bought
the
wood
that
they
dare
not
deal
therewith

For
without
you
get
some
commendment
I
wote
not
how
your
house
shall be
kept
for
I
know
not
whereof

levy
one

that
you

some
remedy

how
they

do

And
I

this
nor
none
other
process
pass
but
be
stopped
as
my
special
trust
is
in
you

For
I
have
sent
up
the
copy
of
the
capias
with
one
letter
from
William
Elesson
and
one
other
from
Undersheriff
that
you
may
after
the
scest
of
them
labour
as
you
think
best
by
your
mind

Also
Sir
Richard
I
pray
you
to
remember
my
other
order
for
Thomas
stable
has
taken
the
west
road
and
the
east
road
and
has
made
the
fences
and
so
she
has
no
grass
to
her
cattle
and
also
they
sow
her
land
and
will
not
let
her
occupy
nothing
as
yet
and
that
discomforts
them
much

No
more

after
the
making

your

Edmund
Robyson
come
home
and
so
I
understand
by
your
letter
that
you
would
understand
if
sir
John
Roclife
servants
have
received
any
farm
in
Yorkshire
but
thereof
I
can
get
no
knowledge
as
yet

But
they
have
sold
oak
wood
at
Nesfeld
and
let
them
stand
to
the
time
of
the
year
one
oak

is
worth
40
pence
for
12
pence
and
also
they
have
sold
aches
at
the
same
place
and
the

are
sold

William
Clapame

holyn

Formes

Quentin

William

hereof
I
can
get
no
more
certainty
as
yet

And
also
there
is
no
more
of
your
tenants
to
get
as

thanks

which
by
your
commandment
have
given
right
good
attendance
on
me
at
this
time
and
specially
to
all
these
ladies
and
gentlewomen
which
has
accompanied
me
hither
and
to
give
credence
to
this
good
lady
the
bearer
here
of
for
I
have
shown
her
more
of
my
mind
than
I
will
write
at
this
time

Sir
I
beseech
your
Grace
to
be
good
and
gracious
lord
to
Thomas
which
was
footman
to
the
Queen
my
mother
whose
soul
God
have
assoiled
for
he
has
been
one
of
my
footmen
hither
with
as
great
diligence
and
labour
to
his
great
charge
of
his
own
good
and
true
minde

I
am
not
able
to
recompense
him
except
the
favour
of
your
Grace

Sir
as
for
news
I
have
none
to
send
but
that
my
Lord
of
Surrey
is
in
great
favour
with
the
King
here
that
he
cannot
forbear
the
company
of
him
no
time
of
the
day

He
and
the
bishop
of
Murrey
orders
every
thing
as
nigh
as
they
can
to
the
King’s
pleasure

I
pray
God
it
may
be
for
my
pour
heart’s
ease
in
time
to
come

They
callnot
my
Chamberlain
to
them
which
I
am
sure
will
speak
better
for
my
part
than
any
of
them
that
be
of
that
council

And
if
he
speak
any
thing
for
my
cause
my
Lord
of
Surrey
has
such
words
unto
him
that
he
dare
speak
no
further

As
for
this
that
I
have
written
to
your
Grace
it
is
very
true
but
I
pray
God
I
may
find
it
well
for
my
welfare
hereafter

No

your
Grace
at
this
time
but
our
Lord

you
in
his

No

Right
worshipful
and
my
singular
good
master
in
the
most
humble
and
lowly
manner
that
I
can
or
may
I
humbly
recommend
me
unto
your
good
mastership
and
unto
my
good
lady
your
wife
desiring
heartily
to
hear
of
your
welfare
and
also
of
your
good
speed
in
your
weighty
and
great
matters
which
I
have
prayed
for
and
shall
do
daily

Sir
I
received
a
letter
from
you
which
bare
day
the
eighth
day
of
June
and
in
that
letter
you
wrote
to
me
that
it
was
my
son
Germane
mind
and
yours
with
other
his
friends
that
I
should
occupy
still
at
Rudburne
as
I
have
done
in
times
as
long
as
we
can
agree
upon
condition
that
I
would
be
as
kind
to
my
said
son
Germane
as
he
intended
to
be
to
me

I
pray
Jesus
that
I
may
find
him
kind
to
me
for
it
is
my
full
intent
and
purpose
to
be
kind
and
loving
unto
him
and
his
wheresoever
I
come

But
thus
the
matter
is
now
that
I
have
taken
another
house
within
the
Freres
at
Derby
which
is
but
of
a
small
charge
and
there
I
intend
to
dispose
myself
to
serve
God
diligently
and
keep
a
narrow
house
and
but
few
of
many
for
I
have
such
discomfort
of
my
son
Thomas
unfortunate
matters
that
it
is
time
for
me
to
get
me
into
a
little
corner
and
so
will
I
do

I
pray
you
continue
my
good
master
and
owe
me
never
the
worse
will
therefore
for
it
rises
on
my
own
mind
to
give
over
great
tugs
of
husbandry
which
I
had
and
take
me
to
less
charge

And
with
God’s
grace
I
shall be
as
kind
to
him
and
to
my
daughter
his
wife
as
ever
I
was
in
my
life
as
well
from
them
as
with
them

With
the
grace
of
Jesus
who
ever
preserve
you

Madam
my
most

wellbeloved
Lady

you
in
the
most
humble

lowly
wise

I
can
beseeching
you
of
your
daily
and
continual
blessings

By
your
Confessor
the
bearer
I
have
received
your
good
and
most
loving
writing
and
by
the
same
have
heard
at
good
leisure
such
credence
as
he
would
show
unto
me
on
your
behalf
und
thereupon
have
sped
him
in
every
behalf
without
delay
according
to
your
noble
petition
and
desire
which
rests
in
two
principal
points
the
one
for
a
general
pardon
for
all
manner
causes
the
other
is
for
to
alter
and
change
part
of
a
Licence
which
I
had
given
unto
you
before
for
to
be
put
into
mortmain
at
Westminster
and
now
to
be
converted
into
the
University
of
Cambridge
for
your
soul’s
health
etcetera

Wherefore
mine
own
most
loving
mother
in
my
most
hearty
manner
I
thank
you
beseeching
you
of
your
good
countenance
in
the
same

And
Madame
your
said
Confessor
has
more(
)over
shown
unto
me
on
your
behalf
that
you
of
your
goodness
and
kind
disposition
have
given
and
granted
unto
me
such
title
and
interest
as
you
have
or
ought
to
have
in
such
debts
and
duties
which
is
owing
and
due
unto
you
in
France
by
the
French
King
and
others
wherefore
Madame
in
my
most
hearty
and
humble
wise
I
thank
you

Albeit
I
verily
think
it
will
be
right
hard
to
recover
it
without
it
be
driven
by
compulsion
and
force
rather
than
by
any
true
justice
which
is
not
yet
as
we
think
any
convenient
time
to
be
put
in
execution

Nevertheless
it
has
pleased
you
to
give
us
a
good
interest
and
mean
if
they
would
not
conform
them
to
reason
and
good
justice
to
defend
or
offend
at
a
convenient
time
when
the
case
shall
so
require
hereafter

For
such
a
chance
may
fall
that
this
your
grant
might
stand
in
great
stead
for
a
recovery
of
our
right
and
to
make
us
free
whereas
we
be
now
bound
etcetera

And
verily
Madame
and
I
might
recover
it
at
this
time
or
any
other
you
be
sure
you
should
have
your
pleasure
therein
as
I
and
all
that
God
has
given
me
is
and
shall
ever
be
at
your
will
and
commandment
as
I
have
instructed
Master
Fisher
more
largely
herein
as
I
doubt
not
but
he
will
declare
unto
you

And
I
beseech
you
to
send
me
your
mind
and
pleasure
in
the
same
which
I
shall
be
full
glad
to
follow
with
God’s
grace

sende
and
give
unto
you
the
full
accomplishment
of
all
your
noble
and
vertuous
desires

of
Idell
for
the
money
that
he
promised
you
and
he
says
he
has
it
not
to
lend
and
makes
chooses
(
excuses
and
so
I
can
get
none
anywhere

And
as
for
wood
there
is
none
that
will
buy
for
they
know
we
want
money
and
without
they
might
have
it
half
for
nothing
they
will
buy
none
for
your
son
William
Plompton
and
Thomas
Bickerdyke
has
been
every
for
that
will
buy
none
without
they
have
timber
trees
and
will
give
nothing
for
them
and
so
shall
your
wood
be
destroyed
and
get
nothing
for
it

Sir
I
told
you
this
or
we
went
but
you
would
not
believe
me

Sir
I
have
taken
of
your
timber
as
much
as
I
can
get
of
or
Whitsunday
farm
forehand
and
that
is
but
little
to
do
you
any
good
for
there
is
but
some
that
will
lend
so
long
afar
the
time

And
your
Lenten
stoufe
is
to
buy
and
I
wrote
not
what
to
do
God
wrote
for
I
am
ever
left
of
this
fashion

Sir
for
God’s
sake
take
an
end
for
we
are
brought
to
beggar
staff
for
you
have
not
to
defend
them
with
all

Sir
I
send
you
my
mare
and
3
shillings
4
pence
by
the
bearer
hereof
and
I
pray
you
send
me
word
as
soon
as
you
may

No
more
at
this
time
but
the
holy
Trinity
send
you
good
speed
in
all
your
matters
and
send
you
soon
home

Sir
remember
your
children
books

By
your
beadfellow
Isabel
Plompton

To
the
right
worshipful
and
my
most
entirely
beloved
good
kind
father
Sir
Robart
Plompton
knight
lying
at
Plompton
in
Yorkshire
be
this
delivered
in
haste

Right
worshipful
father
in
the
most
humble
manner
that
I
can
I
recommend
myself
to
you
and
to
my
lady
my
mother
and
to
all
my
brethren
and
sisters
whom
I
beseech
almighty
God
to
maintain
and
preserve
in
prosperous
health
and
increase
of
worship
entirely
requiring
you
of
your
daily
blessing
letting
you
wit
that
I
send
to
you
message
by
Wryghame
of
Knarsbrugh
of
my
mind
and
how
that
he
should
desire
you
in
my
name
to
send
for
me
to
come
home
to
you
and
as
yet
I
had
no
answer
again
the
which
desire
my
lady
has
got
knowledge

Wherefore
she
is
to
me
more
better
lady
than
ever
she
was
before
insomuch
that
she
has
promised
me
her
good
ladyship
as
long
as
ever
she
shall
live
and
if
she
or
you
can
find
a
thing
mightier
for
me
in
this
parties
or
any
other
she
will
help
to
promote
me
to
the
uttermost
of
her
puissance

And
therefore
I
beseech
you
to
send
a
servant
of
yours
to
my
lady
and
to
me
and
show
now
by
your
fatherly
kindness
that
I
am
your
child
for
I
have
sent
you
diverse
messages
and
writings
and
I
had
never
answered
again

Wherefore
it
is
thought
in
this
parties
by
those
persons
that
list
better
to
say
ill
than
good
that
you
have
little
favour
unto
me
the
which
error
you
may
now
quench
if
it
will
like
you
to
be
so
good
and
kind
father
unto
me

Also
I
beseech
you
to
send
me
a
fine
hat
and
some
good
cloth
to
make
me
some
handkerchiefs

And
thus
I
beseech
Jesus
to
have
you
in
his
blessed
keeping
to
his
pleasure
and
your
heart’s
desire
and
comforts

my

I
can

most
heartily
beseech
our
Lord
to
bless
you
and
my
good
heart
where
that
you
say
that
the
French
King
has
at
this
time
given
me
courtesy
answer
and
written
letter
of

for
the
which
my

And
give
it
so
might

to
the
Cardinal

as
I
understand
is
your
faithful
true

I
wish
my

I
often
have
shown

this

neither

good
a

God
you

been
a
great
hindrance
to
us

For

we
buy
that

I
am

Right

Brother
We
recommend
us
unto
you
in
our
most
heartly
wise

Your
ambassador
Doctor
West
delivered
us
your
loving
letters
in
which
you
show
us
that
where
you
heard
of
our
sickness
you
took
great
heaviness

Dearest
brother
We
are
greatly
rejoiced
that
we
see
you
have
respect
to
our
disease
and
therefore
We
give
you
our
heartly
thanks
and
your
writing
is
to
us
good
comfort

We
can
not
believe
that
of
your
mind
or
by
your
command
we
are
so
friendly
dealt
with
in
our
father’s
Legacy
whereof
we
would
not
have
spoken
nor
written
had
not
the
Doctor
now
spoken
to
us
of
the
samenyng
in
his
credence

It
is
not
worth
such
estimation
as
is
in
your
divers
letters
of
the
samenyng
and
we
lack
no
thing
our
husband
is
ever
the
longer
the
better
to
us
as
knows
God
who

and
bestbeloved

have
you
in

day
of

Your

sister
MARGARET
To
the
right
excellent
right
high
and
mighty
Prince
our
dearest
and
best
beloved
brother
the
King
of
England

Master
Almoner
what
comfort
I
have
with
the
good
tidings
of
your
letter
I
need
not
write
it
to
you
for
the
very
reason
that
I
have
shows
it

The
victory
has
been
so
great
that
I
think
none
such
has
been
seen
before

All
England
has
cause
to
thank
God
of
it
and
I
specially
seeing
that
the
King
begins
so
well
which
is
to
me
a
great
hope
that
theende
shall be
like

I
pray
God
send
the
same
shortly
for
if
this
continues
so
still
I
trust
in
him
that
every
thing
shall
follow
thereafter
to
the
King’s
pleasure
and
my
comfort

M.
Almoner
for
the
pain
you
take
remembering
to
write
to
me
so
often
I
thank
you
for
it
with
all
my
heart
praying
you
to
continue
still
sending
me
word
how
the
King
does
and
if
he
keep
still
his
good
rule
as
he
began

I
think
with
the
company
of
the emperor
and
with
his
good
counsel
his
Grace
shall
not
adventure
himself
so
much
as
I
was
afraid
of
before

I
trust
to
God
he
shall be
thereby
known
for
one
of
the excellentest
princes
in
the
world
and
taken
for
a(
)nother
man
than
he
was
before
thought

M.
Almoner
I
think
myself
that
I
am
so
bound
to
him
for
my
part
that
in
my
letter
I
beseech
the
King
to
rerommend
me
unto
him
and
if
his
Grace
thinks
that
this
shall be
well
done
I
pray
you
to
remember
it

News
fromhence
I
have
none
but
such
as
I
sure
the
counsel
have
advertised
the
King
of
and
thereby
you
shall
see
how
Almighty
God
helps
here
our
part
aswel
as
there

I
trow
the
cause
is
(
as
I
hear
say
that
the
King
disposes
himself
to
him
so
well
that
I
hope
all
shall be
the
better
for
his
merits

And
with
this
I
make
an
ende

KATHERINA
THE
QUEEN
SIR
My
Lord
Howard
has
sent
me
a
letter
open
to
your
Grace
within
one
of
mine
by
the
which
you
shall
see
at
length
the
great
victory
that
our
Lord
has
sent
your
subjects
in
your
absence
and
for
this
cause
it
is
no
need
herein
to
trouble
your
Grace
with
long
writing
but
to
my
thinking
this
battle
has
been
to
your
Grace
and
all
your
realm
the
greatest
honour
that
could
be
and
more
than
you
should
win
all
the
crown
of
France
thanked
be
God
of
it
and
I
am
sure
your
Grace
forgets
not
to
do
this
which
shall
be
cause
to
send
you
many
more
such
great
victories
as
I
trust
he
shall
do

My
husband
for
hastiness
with
Rogecrosse
I
could
not
send
your
Grace
the
piece
of
the
King
of
Scot’s
coat
which
John
Glyn
now
brings

It
should
have
been
better
for
him
to
have
been
in
peace
than
have
this
reward

All
that
God
sends
is
for
the
best

My
Lord
of
Surrey
my
Henry
would
fain
know
your
pleasure
in
the
burying
of
the
King
of
Scot’s
body
for
he
has
written
to
me
so

With
the
next
messenger
your
grace
pleasure
may
be
herein
known

And
with
this
I
make
an
end
praying
God
to
send
you
home
shortly
for
without
this
no
joye
here
can
be
accomplished
and
for
the
same
I
pray
and
now
go
to
our
Lady
at
Walsyngham
that
I
promised
so
long
ago
to
see

At
Woborne
the
16
day
of
September

I
send
your
grace
herein
a
bill
found
in
a
Scotsman’s
purse
of
such
things
as
the
French
King
sent
to
the
said
King
of
Scots
to
make
war
against
you
beseeching
you
to
send
Matthew
hither
as soon
this
messenger
comes
to
bring
me
tidings
from
your
Grace

Your
humble
wife
and
true
servant
KATHERINE

This
matter
is
so
marvellous
that
it
seems
to
be
of
God’s
doing
alone

I
trust
the
King
shall
remember
to
thank
him
for
it
for
so
all
the
Realm
here
has
done
and
because
you
shall
know
by
my
Lord
Howard’s
letter
every
thing
better
than
I
can
write
it
is
no
need
herein
to
say
any
more
of
it

Mr
Almoner
the
King
when
he
was
in
Calais
a
great
while
ago
sent
me
a
Letter
touching
the
matter
betwixt
my
lord
of
Canterbury
and
my
lord
of
Winchester

I
did
after
his
commandment
and
showed
the
same
before
Sir
Thomas
Lovell
and
Mr
Englefeld
unto
my
Lord
of
Canterbury
and
I
prayed
him
to
give
theanswer
shortly
after
the
Kyng’s
mind
as
he
knew
it
for
the
matter
was
so
new
to
me
that
I
would
go
no
further
in
it

Since
that
time
I
have
diverse
seasons
asked
him
for
the
said
answer
which
I
could
never
have
till
now
and
the
same
in
a
letter
I
sent
you
herein
closed

I
pray
you
Master
Almoner
excuse
me
to
the
King
for
the
tarying
of
it
so
long
for
I
could
have
it
no
sooner

And
with
this
I
make
an
end
praying
you
to
continue
your
writing
which
is
to
me
a
great
comfort
and
me
thinks
it
is
a
great
while
ago
that
I
received
any
from
you

At
Woborne
the
xvj
day
of
September

To
Master
Almoner

My
most
dearest
and
best
beloved
brother
I
humbly
recommend
unto
your
grace

Sir
so
it
is
that
I
have
been
very
sick
and
eke
atonce
for
the
which
I
was
fain
to
send
for
Master
Peter
the
physician
for
to
have
holpen
me
of
the
disease
that
I
have

How
be
it
I
am
rather
worse
than
better

Wherefore
I
trust
surely
to
come
up
to
London
with
my
Lord
For
and
if
I
should
tary
here
I
am
sure
I
should
never
aspare
the
sickness
that
I
have

Wherefore
Sir
I
would
be
the
gladder
a
great
deal
to
come
thither
because
I
would
be
glad
to
see
your
grace
the
which
I
do
think
long
for
to
do
for
I
have
been
a
great
while
out
of
your
city
and
now
I
thought
I
shall
not
be
so
long
again
for
the
sight
of
your
grace
is
to
me
the
greatest
comfort
to
me
that
may
be
possible

No
more
to
your
grace
at
this
time
but
I
pray
God
send
you
your
heart’s
desire
and
surely
to
the
sight
of
you

by
your
loving
sister
MARY
THE
FRENCH
QUEEN

Furthermore
the
Duke
of
Bretagne
otherwise
called
the
dauphin
has
divers
seasons
moved
me
to
write
to
your
grace
for
the
said
Francois
forasmuch
as
he
is
one
of
his
servants
the
which
to
do
I
made
him
promise
and
to
the
duke
of
Longuevilee
also
for
I
assure
your
grace
they
made
me
and
the
noblemen
of
my
company
great
cheer
from
Bologne
forth
as
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
the
Lord
marquis
with
other
noble
men
can
inform
your
grace

These
premises
considered
I
beseech
your
grace
to
desire
the
Lord
Darcy
to
deliver
upon
as
little
a
ransom
as
reasonably
may
be
his
said
prisoner
for
as
I
am
credibly
informed
here
he
is
but
a
poor
gentleman

Now
somewhat
I
would
that
my
Lord
the
King
(
and
the
both
dukes
to
whom
I
am
much
bound
should
think
he
should
be
the
more
favoured
for
my
sake

When
this
man
is
delivered
I
beseech
you
to
send
word
by
the
bringer
of
this
or
some
other
what
his
ransom
is
which
I
pray
God
may
be
reasonable
and
little
who
preserve
your
grace

Amen

From
Abbeville
the
18th
day
of
October
by
your
very
loving
sister
MARY
QUEEN
OF
FRANCE

To
my
most
kind
and
loving
brother
the
King's
grace
of
England

MY
good
Brother
as
heartily
I
can
I
recommend
me
unto
your
Grace
marveling
much
that
I
never
heard
from
you
since
re
departing
so
often
as
I
have
sent
and
written
to
you

For
else
if
any
chance
happens
other
than
well
I
shall
not
know
where
nor
of
whom
to
ask
any
good
counsel
to
your
pleasure
nor
yet
to
mine
own
profit

I
marvel
much
that
my
Lord
of
Norfolk
would
at
all
times
so
lightly
grant
every
thing
at
their
requests
here

I
am
well
assured
that
when
you
know
the
truth
of
every
thing
as
my
mother
Guldford
can
show
you
you
would
full
little
have
thought
I
should
have
been
thus
intreated
that
would
God
my
Lord
of
York
had
come
with
me
in
the
roam
of
Norfolk
for
then
am
I
sure
I
should
have
been
left
much
more
at
my
hearti
than
I
am
now

And
thus
I
bid
your
Grace
farewell
with
as
ever
had
Prince
and
more
heart’s
ease
than
I
have
now
From
Abville
the
12th
day
of
Octobre

give
credence
to
my
mother
Guldford

By
your
loving
sister
MARY
QUEEN
OF
FRANCE

I
recommend
me
unto
you
as
heartly
as
I
can
and
as
schoth
entreated
as
the
King
and
you
thought
I
should
have
been
for
the
morn
next
after
the
marriage
all
my
servants
both
men
and
women
were
discharged

Insomuch
that
my
mother
Guldford
was
also
discharged
whom
as
you
know
the
King
and
you
willed
me
in
any
wise
to
be
councelled

And
for
my
part
my
Lord
as
you
love
the
King
my
brother
and
me
find
the
means
that
she
may
in
all
haste
come
hither
again
for
I
had
as
lief
lose
the
winning
I
schall
have
in
France
as
to
lose
her
counsel
when
I
shall
lack
it
which
is
not
like
long
to
be
required
as
I
am
sure
the
noble
men
and
gentlemen
can
show
you
more
than
becomes
me
to
write
in
this
matter

I
pray
you
my
Lord
give
credence
further
to
my
mother
Guldford
in
every
thing
concerning
this
matter

And
albeit
my
Lord
of
Norfolk
has
neither
dealt
best
with
me
nor
yet
with
her
at
this
time
yet
I
pray
you
always
to
be
good
lord
un
to
her

And
would
to
God
my
had
been
so
good
to
have
had
you
with
me
hither
when
I
had
my
lord
of
Norfolk

And
thus
fare
ye
well
My
Lord

Written
from
Abbeville
the
12th
day
of
October

My
Lord
I
pray
you
give
credence
to
my
mother
Guldford
in
my
sorrows
she
have
delivered

Your
on
while

live

my
most
humble
wise
I
recommend

your

that
I
do
a

by
my

you
are
pleased
and
contented
that
he
shall
resort
on
to
your
presence
at
such
time
as
your
Grace
shall
be
at
his
manner
of
Donington
whereby
I
see
well
he
is
marvelously
rejoyced
and
much
comforted
that
it
has
liked
your
Grace
so
to
be
pleased
for
the
which
your
special
goodness
to
him
showed
in
that
behalf
and
for
sundry
and
many
other
your
kindness
as
well
to
me
as
to
him
showed
and
given
in
diverse
causes
I
most
humbly
thank
your

assuring
you
that
for
the

I
account
my
self

muche
bound

as
ever
sister
was

according
there
unto

shall
to
the
best
of
my
power
during
my
life
endure
myself
as
far
as
in
me
shall
be
possible
to
do
the
thing
that
shall
stand
with
your
pleasure
and
if
it
had
be
time
convenient
to
your
Grace
had
be
there
with
pleased

Mine
own
good
and
most
kind
brother
I
recommend
me
unto
your
grace
and
thank
you
for
the
good
and
kind
letters
that
you
have
sent
me
the
which
has
been
the
greatest
comfort
might
be
unto
me
in
this
world
desiring
your
grace
so
for
to
continue
for
there
is
nothing
so
great
a
store
to
me
as
for
to
see
you
the
which
I
would
very
fain
have
the
time
for
to
come
as
I
trust
it
shall
be
or
else
I
would
be
very
sorry
for
I
think
every
day
a
thousand
till
I
may
see
you

Sir
whereas
your
grace
sends
me
word
that
I
will
not
give
no
credence
to
them
for
no
suit
nor
for
no
other
words
that
shall
be
given
me
sir
I
promise
your
grace
that
I
never
made
them
no
promise
nor
no
other
for
them
nor
never
will
until
that
I
know
your
grace's
mind
for
nobody
alive
for
your
grace
is
all
the
comfort
that
I
have
in
this
world
and
I
trust
your
grace
will
not
fail
for
I
have
nothing
in
this
world
that
I
care
for
but
to
have
the
good
and
kind
mind
that
your
grace
had
ever
toward
me
which
I
beseech
your
grace
to
continue
for
therein
is
my
trust
that
I
have
in
this
world

Sir
as
for
the
letter
that
your
grace
did
send
me
by
Master
Clinton
whereas
you
send
me
word
that
I
should
provide
myself
and
make
me
ready
for
to
come
to
your
grace
sir
and
it
were
tomorrow
I
would
be
ready
and
as
for
my
lord
of
Suffolk
and
Sir
Richard
Wingfield
and
Doctor
West
there
be
two
or
three
that
came
from
the
king
my
son
for
to
have
brought
them
to
him
by
the
way
as
they
came
hitherward
and
so
hindered
them
coming
hitherward

Sir
I
beseech
your
grace
for
to
be
good
lord
to
Mr.
John
your
surgeon
for
my
sake
and
that
you
will
not
be
miscontented
with
him
for
his
long
tarrying
here
with
me
for
I
bore
him
an
hand
that
your
grace
were
contented

he
should

here
with
me
awhile

I
pray
your
grace
to
give
him
leave
for
to
tarry
here
awhile
with
me
for
because
I
am
very
ill-diseased
with
the
toothache
and
the
mother
withal
that
some
times
I
wot
not
what
for
to
do
but
an
I
might
see
your
grace
I
were
healed

No
more
to
you

I
pray
God
to
send
your

good

Mine

I
pray
you
as
my

is
in
you
for
to
remember
me
to
the

now
I

you

my

I
will be

so
I
pray
you
my

show
his

saying
that
the
King
my
husband
is
departed
to
God
of

soul
God
pardon

And
whereas
you
advise
me
that
I
should
make
no
promise
My
Lord
I
trust
the
King
my
brother
and
you
will
not
reckon
in
me
such
childhood

I
trust
I
have
so
ordered
my
self
so
since
that
I
came
hither
that
I
trust
it
has
been
to
the
honour
of
the
King
my
brother
and
me
since
I
come
hither
and
so
I
trust
to
continue

If
there
be
any
thing
that
I
may
do
for
you
I
would
be

to
do
it
in

thanking
you
entirely
of
your

beseeching
your

most
humbly
now
so
to
continue
toward
me
and
my
friends
as
our
special
trust
is
in
your
grace
and
that
it
may
like
you
with
all
convenient
diligence
to
send
for
me
that
I
may
shortly
see
your

which
is
the
thing
that
I
most
desire
in

MY
LORD
DAKERS
I
recommend
me
to
you
as
heartily
as
I
can
and
I
have
seen
your
writing
and
understand
at
length
and
I
perceive
that
you
are
not
sikerly
informed
in
what
state
I
stand
in
for
yous
trow
that
I
may
pass
wherever
I
will
wish
is
not
true
but
this
bearer
can
show
you
the
truth
of
all
and
what
my
mind
is
and
how
I
am
constrained
to
do
against
my
will

And
I
pray
you
give
him
credence
as
you
would
do
to
my
self
for
it
is
over
long
to
write
for
I
have
great
trust
in
this
man

And
send
me
your
utter
mind
and
answer
in
all
thing
and
God
keep
you

written
with
my
hand
this
Monday

But
my
lord
I
am
gladder
of
the
tidings
that
the
King’s
grace
told
me
of
the
Duke
of
Albany
that
he
will
come
hither
which
I
beseech
God
may
be
true
but
I
dread
it
be
not

My
lord
I
think
right
long
while
I
speak
with
you
for
next
the
King’s
grace
my
most
trust
is
in
you
and
you
may
do
me
most
good
of
any
and
I
pray
you
my
lord
as
soon
as
any
body
comes
out
of
Scotland
that
you
will
send
me
word
for
I
think
long
till
I
hear
tidings

No
more
but
God
have
you
in
his
keeping

especial
for
them
which
you
have
sent
me
now
of
late

My
lord
you
remember
I
doubt
not
that
at
my
last
being
at
Guildford
you
desired
the
king
my
brother
to
give
unto
my
trusty
and
well-beloved
almoner
doctor
Denton
the
prebend
in
St
Stephens
which
as
then
the
dean
of
his
chapel
and
now
bishop
of
Lincoln
had
in
possession
as
then
the
king's
grace
showed
me
in
your
presence
that
he
should
have
it
and
also
you
promised
me
the
same
and
to
solicit
the
king
my
brother
for
the
performance
of
his
promise

I
pray
you
my
lord
send
me
word
of
your
mind
and
that
there
be
none
excuse
made
for
I
assure
you
my
lord
my
promise
shall
be
without
any
excuse
if
God
send
me
life
I
will
not
say
that
word
that
I
would
not
wilfully
perform
as
knows
his
grace

My

In
my
most
hearty
manner
I
recommend
me
unto
you
letting
you
the
same
to
understand
that
my
lord
of
Suffolk
has
sent
me
your
letters
which
lately
he
received
by
Cooke
by
which
I
perceive
the
faithful
good
mind
which
you
do
bear
unto
us
both
and
how
that
you
be
determined
not
to
leave
us
in
our
extreme
trouble
for
the
which
your

fast
(
faithful
and
loving
dealing
I
most
entirely
thank
you
requiring
you
to
continue
towards

as
you
have
been
which
shall

any
of
our
behalf’s
but
to
the
uttermost
of
our
power
we
shall
be
always
ready
to
show
you
all

Queen-Dowager
of
France
to
her
Brother
King
Henry
VIII

A.D

1515

Pleased
it
your
grace
to
my
greatest
discomfort
sorrow
and
disconsolation
but
lately
I
have
been
advertised
of
the
great
and
high
displeasure
which
your
highness
bears
unto
me
and
my
lord
of
Suffolk
for
the
marriage
between
us

Sir
I
will
not
in
any
wise
deny
but
that
I
have
offended
your
grace
for
the
which
I
do
put
myself
most
humbly
in
your
clemency
and
mercy

Nevertheless
to
the
intent
that
your
highness
should
not
think
that
I
had
simply
carnally
or
of
any
sensual
appetite
done
the
same
I
having
no
regard
to
fall
in
your
grace's
displeasure
I
assure
your
grace
that
I
had
never
done
against
your
ordinance
and
consent
but
by
the
reason
of
the
great
despair
wherein
I
was
put
by
the
two
friars
which
has
certified
me
in
case
I
come
to
England
your
council
would
never
consent
to
the
marriage
between
the
said
lord
and
me
with
many
other
sayings
concerning
the
same
promise
so
that
I
verily
thought
that
the
said
friars
would
never
have
offered
to
have
made
me
like
overture
unless
they
might
have
had
charge
from
some
of
your
council
the
which
put
me
in
such
consternation
fear
and
doubt
of
the
obtaining
of
the
thing
which
I
desired
most
in
this
world
that
I
rather
chose
to
put
me
in
your
mercy
accomplishing
the
marriage
than
to
put
me
in
the
order
of
your
council
knowing
them
to
be
otherwise
minded

By
your
loving
and
most
humble
sister
MARY

To
the
King's
grace

Mary
Queen-Dowager
of
France
to
Wolsey

A.D

1515

My
very
good
Lord
With
all
my
heart
I
commend
me
unto
you

I
understand
that
it
has
pleased
the
King
my
brother
to
promote
doctor
West
being
here
one
of
his
ambassadors
to
the
bishopric
of
Ely
whereof
I
am
right
glad

By
reason
of
which
promotion
he
must
depart
with
divers
of
his
benefices
among
which
he
has
two
one
called
Egglesfield
in
the
bishopric
of
Durham
and
the
other
the
archdeaconry
of
Derby
which
(
as
I
am
informed
be
of
no
great
value

And
thus
the
Holy
Ghost
preserve
you

CECYL
DORSET

Please
it
your
good
lordship
to
understand
that
since
the
beginning
of
the
Parliament
there
has
been
the
greatest
and
sorest
hold
in
the
lower
House
for
payment
of
2
shillings
of
the
pound
that
ever
was
seen
I
think
in
any
parliament

This
matter
has
been
debated
and
beaten
15
or
16
days
together
the
highest
necessity
alleged
on
the
King’s
behalf
to
us
that
ever
was
heard
of
and
of
the
contrary
the
highest
poverty
confessed
as
well
by
knights
squires
and
gentlemen
of
every
quarter
as
by
the
commoners
citizens,and
burgesses

There
has
been
such
hold
that
the
House
was
like
to
have
been
dissevered
that
is
to
say
the
Knights
being
of
the
King’s
Council
the
King’s
servants
and
gentlemen
of
the
one
party
which
in
so
long
time
were
spoken
with
and
made
to
say
yes
it
may
fortune
contrarie
to
their
heart
will
and
conscience

Thus
hanging
this
matter
yesterday
the
more
part
being
the
King’s
servants
gentlemen
were
there
assembled
and
so
they
being
the
more
part
willed
and
gave
to
the
King
2
shillings
of
the
pound
of
goods
or
lands
the
beste
to
be
taken
for
the
King
all
lands
to
pay
2
shillings
of
the
pound
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
the
goods
to
pay
2
shillings
of
the
pound
from
20
pounds
upwards
and
from
40
shillings
of
goods
to
20
pounds
to
pay
16
pence
of
the
pound
and
under
40
shillings
every
person
to
pay
8
pence
this
to
be
payed
in
2
years

I
have
heard
no
man
in
my
life
that
can
remember
that
ever
there
was
given
to
any
one
of
the
King’s
ancestors
half
somuch
at
one
grant
nor
I
think
there
was
never
such
a
president
seen
before
this
time
I
beseech
almighty
God
it
may
be
well
and
peaceably
levied
and
surely
payed
unto
the
King’s
Grace
without
grudge
and
specially
without
losing
the
good
wills
and
true
hearts
of
his
subjects
which
I
reckon
a
far
greater
treasure
for
a
King
than
gold
or
silver

But
no
day
is
appointed
thereof

I
think
now
that
this
matter
is
so
far
passed
that
the
parliament
will
soon
be
ended

Asto
the
convocation
amongst
the
priests
the
first
day
of
their
appearance
as soon
as
mass
of
the
holy
ghost
at
Paul’s
was
done
my
lord
Cardinal
cited
all
them
to appear
before
him
in
his
convocation
at
Westminster
which
so
did
and
there
was
another
mass
of
the
holy
ghost
and
within
6
or
7
days
the
priests
proved
that
all
that
my
lord
Cardinal’s
convocation
should
do
it
should
be
void
because
that
their
summons
was
to appear
before
my
Lorde
of
Canterbury
which
thing
so
espied
my
lorde
Cardinal
has
addressed
out
of
new
citations
in
to
every
country
commanding
the
priests
to appear
before
him
7
days
after
the Ascension
and
then
I
think
they
shall
have
the
3rd
mass
of
the
Holy
Ghost

I
pray
God
the
holy
ghost
be
amongst
them
and
us
both

I
do
tremble
to
remember
the
end
of
all
this
high
and
new
enterprises
for
often
times
it
has
been
seen
that
to
a
new
enterprise
there
follows
a
new
manner
and
strange
sequel

God
of
his
mercy
send
his
grace
of
such
fashion
that
it
may
be
all
for
the
best

To ascertain
you
of
the
King
of
Denmark's
being
in
Flanders
with
16
ships
with
his
wife
and
children
meseems
I
should
not
write
it
unto
you
because
I
think
you
be
advertised
thereof
by
post

How
this
2
shillings
of
the
pound
shall be
levied
of
what
manner
or
at
what
days
it
shall be
paid
in
good
faith
I
know
not
as
yet

Under
your
good
favour
meseems
and
if
you
think
it
best
it
were
a
gracious
deed
for
you
to
be
mean
unto
the
King’s
Highness
that
10
or
12
thousand
pounds
of
this
money
might
be
bestowed
on
the
building
up
again
of
the
piles
and
castles
on
our
English
borders
specially
now
that
they
of
Scotland
be
prostrate
by
your
good
and
high
policy

As
other
news
or
affairs
shall
chance
so
shall
I
be
glad
with
diligence
to advertise

Easthamstead
26
August
1523
It
may
like
your
good
Grace
to
be
advertised
that
the
King's
Highness
yesterday
received
a
letter
from
his
viceadmiral
dated
on
the
see
the
14th
day
of
August
which
letter
your
Grace
shall
receive
with
these
presents

And
forasmuch
as
the
valiant
acquittal
of
Mr.
Fittzwilliam
and
his
company
singularly
well
contents
the
King’s
Highness
as
a
thing
much
redounding
to
the honour
of
his
Grace
and
his
realm
with
high
reproach
and
rebuke
of
his
enemies
he
requires
your
Grace
therefore
that
as
well
his
viceadmiral
as
other
gentlemen
of
his
company
such
as
your
grace
shall
think
convenient
may
have
sent
unto
them
letters
of
thanks
by
which
they
may
to
their
comfort
and
further
courage
understand
how
acceptable
their
good
service
is
unto
his
Highness

Furthermore
as
touching
the
two
ships
which
your
Grace
has
devised
to
be
sent
unto
Sir
Anthony
Pointtz
albeit
that
Mr
Viceadmiral
as
your
Grace
may
perceive
by
his
letter
moves
3
things
which
he
thinks
would
be
considered
therein
yet
sith
your
Grace
has
had
a
political
foresight
to
the
provision
of
the
vital
which
is
the
greatest
thing
that
his
Grace
regards
his
pleasure
is
according
to
your
most
prudent
advice
that
for
to
put
the
mater
in
the
more
surety
the
said
two
ships
shall
in
any
wise
go
forth
and
that
they
shall
there
continue
till
half
the
month
of
September
be
passed
after
which
time
his
Grace
thinks
it
good
that
Sir
Anthony
Pointtz
and
his
company
should
be
discharged
for
after
that
time
his
Grace
believes
that
the
Duke
of
Albany
either
shall
not
go
in
to
Scotland
or
else
shall
go
to
late
to
do
either
them
good
or
us
hurt
and
therefore
it
seems
to
his
Grace
good
that
he
should
after
the
middle
of
this
next
month
discharge
him
self
of
that
cost

In
the
mean
while
his
Highness
requires
your
Grace
that
those
ships
may
be
so
speedily
and
sufficiently
vitailled
for
the
whole
time
of
their
abode
upon
their
enterprise
there
as
he
does
not
but
your
Grace
has
and
will
provide
therefore
that
no
lack
of
vitaile
hinder
or
impeach
their
purpose

It
may
further
like
your
good
Grace
to
understand
that
the
King’s
Grace
much
allows
your
prudent
answer
made
unto
the Emperors
Ambassador
upon
the
safe conduct

Wherefore
his
Grace
for
his
part
according
to
your
Grace's
political
advice
is
as
yet
in
mind
neither
to
ratify
that
safe conduct
nor
to
grant
any
like
and
is
glad
that
your
Grace
so
showed
unto
the Emperors
ambassador

It
may
further
like
your
good
Grace
to
be
advertised
that
one
Thomas
Murner
a
friar
of
Saint
Francisco
order
which
wrote
a
book
against
Luther
in
defence
of
the
King’s
book
was
out
of
Allemagne
sent
in
to
England
by
the
means
of
a
simple
person
an
Allemand
naming
him
self
servant
unto
the
King’s
Grace
and
affirming
unto
murner
that
the
King
had
given
him
in
charge
to
desire
Murner
to
come
over
to
him
into
England
and
by
the occasion
thereof
he
has
come
over
and
has
now
been
here
a
good
while

Wherefore
the
King’s
Grace
pitying
that
he
was
so
deceived
and
having
tender
respect
to
the
good
zeal
that
he
bears
toward
the
faith
and
his
good
heart
and
mind
toward
his
Highnesss
requires
your
Grace
that
it
may
like
you
to
cause
him
have
in
reward
one
hundred
pound
and
that
he
may
return
home
where
his
presence
is
very
necessary
for
he
is
one
of
the
chief
stays
against
the
faction
of
Luther
in
that
parties
against
whom
he
has
written
many
books
in
the
Allemand
tongue
and
now
since
his
coming
hither
he
has
translated
In
to
Latin
the
book
that
he
before
made
in
Almaigne
in
defence
of
the
King’s
book

He
is
Doctor
of
Divinity
and
of
both
laws
and
a
man
for
writing
and
preaching
of
great
estimation
in
his
country

It
may
like
your
Grace
further
to
know
that
the
same
simple
person
which
caused
Murner
to
come
in
to
England
has
now
come
to
the
Court
and
has
brought
with
him
a
baron’s
son
of
Allemagne
to
whom
he
has
also
persuaded
that
the
King’s
Grace
would
be
glad
to
have
him
in
his
service

He
has
also
brought
letters
from
Duke
Ferdinand
unto
the
King’s
Grace
which
letters
I
send
unto
your
Grace
wherein
he
desires
the
King’s
Highness
to
take
in
to
his
service
and
to
retain
with
some
convenient
yearly
pension
Ducem
Mechelburgensem
of
which
request
the
King’s
Grace
greatly
marvels
and
verily
thinks
that
this
simple
fellow
which
brought
the
letters
likewise
as
he
caused
Murner
to
cum
hither
and
persuaded
the
barons
son
that
the
King
would
be
glad
to
have
his
service
so
has
by
some
simple
ways
brought
the
Duke
of
Mechelborough
in
the
mind
that
the
King’s
Grace
would
at
the
contemplation
of
Duke
Ferdinand’s
letters
be
content
to
retain
the
Duke
of
Mechelborough
with
a
verily
pension

The
fellow
has
brought
also
from
the
Duke
of
Mechelborough
letters
of
credence
written
in
the
Dutch
tongue

He
bare
him
self
in
Allemagne
for
the
King’s
servant
and
boasted
that
he
had
a
yearly
pension
of
his
Grace
of
fifty
marks
and
that
the
King
had
sent
him
thither
to
take
up
servants
for
him

Wherever
his
Grace
requires
yours
to
give
him
your
prudent
advice
as
well
in
a
convenient
answer
to
be
made
both
to
Duke
Ferdinand
and
the
Duke
of
Mechelborough
as
also
in
what
wise
it
shall be
convenient
to
order
this
simple
fellow
that
so
has
deceived
men
in
the
King’s
name

Furthermore
it
may
like
your
good
Grace
to
understand
that
at
the
contemplation
of
your
Grace's
letters
the
King’s
Highness
is
graciously
content
that
beside
the
100
pounds
for
my
fe
for
the office
of
the
Speaker
of
his
Parliament
to
be
taken
at
the
receipt
of
his
Exchequer
I
shall
have
one
other
hundred
pounds
out
of
his
coffers
by
the hands
of
the
Treasurer
of
his
Chamber
wherefore
in
most
humble
wise
I
beseech
your
good
Grace
that
as
your
gracious
favour
has
obtained
it
for
me
so
it
may
like
the
same
to
write
to
Mr.
Wiatt
that
he
may
deliver
it
to
such
as
I
shall
send
for
it
whereby
I
and
all
mine
as
the
manifold
goodness
of
your
Grace
has
already
bound
us
shall be
daily
more
and
more
bound
to
pray
for
your
Grace
whom
our
Lord
long
preserve
in
honour
and
health

At
Esthamstede

Your

Woking

September
1523
It
may
like
your
good
Grace
to
be
advertised
that
according
to
your
Grace's
commandment
given
me
by
your
letters
dated
the
30th
day
of
August
I
have
showed
unto
the
King’s
Grace
the
bill
devised
for
Sir
Richard
Wyngfeld
subscribed
by
your
Grace
and
the
old
bill
also
advertising
his
Grace
of
such
things
as
your
Grace
in
the
new
bill
caused
to
be
left
out
for
the advantage
of
his
Highness
which
points
I
showed
his
Grace
cancelled
in
the
old
bill
and
omitted
in
the
new
for
which
his
Highness
with
hearty
thanks
to
your
Grace
for
your
labour
taken
therein
has
signed
the
new
which
I
have
delivered
to
him
of
whom
I
received
it

And
thus
our
Lord
long
preserve
your
good
Grace
in
honour
and
health

At
Okyng
the
first
day
of
September

September
1523
It
may
like
your
good
Grace
to
be
advertised
that
I
have
received
your
Grace's
letters
directed
to
my
self
dated
the
last
day
of
August
with
the
letters
of
my
Lord
Admiral
to
your
Grace
sent
in
post
and
copies
of
letters
sent
between
the
Queen
of
Scots
and
his
Lordship
concerning
the
matters
and
affairs
of
Scotland
with
the
prudent
answers
of
your
Grace
as
well
to
my
said
Lord
in
your
own
name
as
in
the
name
of
the
King’s
Highness
to
the
said
Queen
of
Scots

His
Highness
in
your
Grace's
letter
directed
to
my
Lord
Admiral
marked
and
well
liked
that
your
Grace
touched
my
said
Lord
and
my
Lord
Dacres
in
that
that
their
opinions
had
been
to
the
let
of
the
great
road
which
if
it
had
been
ere
this
time
made
in
to
Scotland
as
by
your
prudent
advice
it
had
if
their
opinions
with
other
had
not
beene
four
shillings
to
the
contrary
it
should
as
by
the
Queen’s
letter
appeared
have
been
the occasion
of
some
great
and
good
effect

His
Highness
also
well
allowed
that
your
Grace’s
notes
not
only
remiss
dealing
but
also
some
suspicion
in
that
the
Lord
Dacres
so
little
esteemed
the
mind
and
opinion
of
the
King’s
sister
whereof
he
had
by
his
servant
so
perfect
knowledge

Finally
his
Highness
is
of
the
mind
of
your
Grace
and
singularly
commends
your
policy
in
that
your
Grace
determines
for
a
final
way
that
my
Lord
Admiral
shall
set
forth
his
enterprises
without
any
longer
tract
of
time
not
ceasing
to
press
them
with
all
the
annoyance
possible
till
they
fall
earnestly
and
effectively
to
some
better
train
and
conformity

And
verily
his
Highness
thinks
as
your
Grace
writes
that
for
any
lack
of
those
things
which
as
he
writes
are
not
yet
come
to
him
he
should
not
have
needed
to
forbear
to
have
done
them
with
smaller
roads
at
the
least
way
some
annoyance
in
the
mean
season

I
read
also
to
his
Highness
the
letter
of
Mr.
Doctor
Knight
written
unto
your
Grace
with
your
Grace's
letter
written
to
my
self
by
the
tenor
whereof
his
Grace
well
perceives
your
most
prudent
answer
devised
and
made
as
well
to
his
said
Ambassador
as
to
the Ambassador
of
the Emperor
concerning
the
disbursing
of
such
money
as
his
Highness
should
lay
out
for
the entertainment
of
the
10,100
lance
knights
wherein
his
Grace
highly
well
approves
as
well
your
most
political
foresight
so
wisely
doubting
lest
this
delay
of
the
declaration
might
happen
to
be
a
device
whereby
the Emperor
might
spare
his
own
charge
and
entertain
the Allemands
with
the only
cost
of
the
King’s
Grace
as
also
your
most
prudent
order
taken
therein
by
which
his
Highness
shall be
bound
to
no
charge
except
the
duke
first
pass
the
articles
sent
by
Sir
John
Russell
and
that
the
10,000
Allemands
be
levied
and
joined
with
the
Duke
and
he
declared
enemy
to
the
French
King

I
read
also
to
his
Highness
the
copy
of
your
Grace's
letter
devised
to
Mr
Doctor
Sampson
and
Mr
Jernyngham
wherein
his
Highness
well
perceived
and
marked
what
labour
and
pain
your
Grace
had
taken
as
well
in
substantial
advertising
his
said
Ambassadors
at
length
of
all
occurrences
here
with
the
goodly
rehearsal
of
the
valiant
acquittal
of
his
army
on
the
sea
not
only
there
done
but
also
descending
on
the
land
with
all
his
preparations
and
armies
set
forth
and
furnished
as
well
toward
France
as
Scotland
as
also
In
your
good
and
substantial
instructions
given
unto
them
for
the
semblable
advancing
of
the Emperor's
army
and
actual
invasion
to
be
made
on
that
side
for
his
part

His
Highness
has
also
seen
and
signed
the
letters
by
your
Grace
devised
in
his
name
as
well
to
Don
Ferdinando
and
to
the
Duke
of
Mechelberge
in
answer
of
their
late
letters
sent
unto
his
Grace
as
also
to
the
Duke
of
Ferare
in
commendation
of
the
King’s
orators
in
case
the
Duke
accept
the
Order

In
the
reading
and
advising
of
all
which
things
his
Highness
said
that
he
perceived
well
what
labour
study
pain
and
travail
your
Grace
had
taken
in
the
device
and
pennyng
of
so
many
so
great
things
so
high
well
dispatched
in
so
brief
time
when
the
only
reading
thereof
held
him
above
two
hours
his
Highness
therefore
commanded
me
to
write
unto
your
Grace
that
for
your
labour
travail
study
pain
and
diligence
he
gives
your
Grace
his
most
hearty
and
not
more
hearty
than
highly
well
deserved
thanks

thank
you
for
your

favour
lately
showed
at
my
desire
unto
my

Richard
Wilbram
in
the
behalf
of
his
father

I
now
eftsoon
desire
and
heartily
pray
you
to
show
your
lawful
favour
and
goodness
unto
Sir
Rice
Mauncell
this
bearer
in
such
matters
and
business
as
he
is
a
suitor
unto
you
for
the
said
Sir
Rice
has
married
one
of
my
gentlewomen
whom
for
her
long
and
acceptable
service
to

done
I
much
esteem
and

Wherefore
if
you
would
at
this
my
desire
extend
your
goodness
and
favour
unto
him
in
that
behalf
so
that
he
might
perceive
his
said
suit
than rather
thereby
to
take
good
effect
you
therein
should
minister
unto
me
very
acceptable
pleasure
which
I
shall
hereafter
remember
accordingly

By
the
Queen

Trusty
and
right
welbeloved
we
greet
you
well

And
whereas
we
be
credibly
informed
that
the
bearer
hereof
Richard
Herman
merchant
and
citizen
of
Antwerp
in
Brabant
was
in
the
time
of
the
late
lord
Cardinal
put
and
expelled
from
his
freedom
and
fellowship
of
and
in
the
English
house
there
for
nothing
else
(
as
he
affirmed
but
only
for
that
that
he
did
both
with
his
goodies
and
policies
to
his
great
hurt
and
hindrance
in
this
world
helped
to
the
setting
forth
of
the
News
Testament
in
English

We
therefore
desire
and
instantly
pray
you
that
with
all
speed
and
favour
convenient
ye
will
cause
this
good
and
honest
merchant
being
my
Lord’s
true
faithful
and
loving
subject
restored
to
his
pristine
freedom
liberty
and
fellowship
aforesaid
and
the
sooner
at
this
our
request
and
at
your
good
leasure
to
hear
him
in
such
things
as
he
has
to
make
further
relation
unto
you
in
this
behalf

Even
under
our
Signet
at
my
Lord’s
manor
of

of

Chief
Secretary
unto
my
Lord
the
King’s
Highness

Master

a
poor
desolate
widow
without
comfort
as
to
my
special
trust
under
God
and
my
Prince
I
have
me
most
humbly
recommended
unto
you
praying
you
after
your
accustomed
gentle
manner
to
all
them
that
be
in
such
lamentable
case
as
I
am
in
to
be
mine
to
the
King’s
gracious
Highness
for
me
for
such
poor
stuff
and
plate
as
my
husband
had
whom
God
pardon
that
of
his
gracious
and
mere
liberality
I
may
have
him
to
help
me
to
my
poor
living
which
to
his
Highness
is
nothing
to
be
regarded
and
to
me
should
be
a
most
high
help
and
succour

And
farther
more
where
that
the
King’s
Highness
and
my
Lord
my
father
paid
great
sums
of
money
for
my
Jointer
to
the
Earl
of
Wiltshire
to
the
sum
of
two
thousand
marks
and
I
not
assured
of
no
more
during
the
said
Earl’s
natural
life
than
one
hundred
mark
which
is
very
hard
for
me
to
shift
the
world

JANE
ROCHEFORD

Master
Moore
I
commend
me
heartily
unto
you
and
right
joyously
and
glad
I
am
to
understand
how
most
consolingly
and
with
what
reverence
humility
and
devotion
the
King's
Highness
received
the
holy
Jubilee
to
the
great
merit
as
I
trust
in
God
of
his
Grace
and
to
the
most
holy
religious
and
honourable
example
comfort
and
rejoice
as well
of
all
those
that
were
present
at
the
beholding
and
doing
thereof
as
to
all
other
his
subjects

And
semblably
glad
I
am
that
his
Grace
like
a
most
kind
and
gracious
prince
and
master
tendering
more
the
health
of
his
servants
officers
and
ministers
than
his
own
private
and
particular
profit
is
contented
by
your
good
meditation
to
adjourn
the
term
which
undoubtedly
is
not
only
to
the
comfort
of
all
such
as
should
attend
thereat
but
also
the
King's
Grace
have
gotten
thereby
many
prayers
great
and
most
humble
thanks
for
the
same

And
there
shall
no
loss
nor
hindrance
to
his
affairs
ensue
thereby

You
shall
also
advertise
the
King's
Grace
how
Monsieur
John
Joachim
has
been
with
me
and
communicate
such
news
as
be
written
unto
the
President
and
him
in
ciphers
sent
out
of
France
whereby
does
appear
that
by
reason
of
the Emperor’s
high
demands
the
French
King's
deliverance
is
not
likely
to
be
so
soon
as
the
President
reported
unto
the
King
at
his
being
here
for
now
the Emperor
perceiving
that
the
French
King
is
out
of
peril
of
death
and
perfectly
recovered
requires
the
whole
Duchy
of
Burgon
the
same
to
be
held
of
the Empire

MASTER
MORE

Albeit
I
am
very
joyously
that
my
proceedings
devises
and
conferences
with
the
ambassadors
have
been
to
the
King’s
contention
with
the ambassadors
in
putting
over
without
discouraging
of
the
confederates
his
Grace's
entree
in
to
the
liege
yet
now
I
am
in
no
small
perplexity
how
the
same
may
be
continued
forasmuch
as
commissions
and
auctorites
as well
from
the
Popes
Holiness
as
from
the
Seniory
of
Venice
be
arrived
here
and
hourly
the
ambassador
of
France
looks
for
the
semblable
from
his
master

For
now
if
upon
the
exhibition
of
the
said
commissions
I
should
not
fail
in
treaty
with
them
upon
the
King’s
said
entree
there
might
thereby
be
given
unto
them
vehement
cause
of
suspicion
which
percase
might
drive
them
the
rather
in
to
the Emperor’s
devotion
and
the
less
hereafter
to
esteem
the
King’s
Highness

And
in
my
poor
opinion
it
shall
more
stand
with
the
King’s
honour
and
reputation
thus
to
proceed
with
the
said
ambassadors
than
not
to
treat
with
them
considering
they
be
furnished
with
such
commissions
as
was
or
is
devised
and
desired
by
the
King’s
Highness

Better
it
shall be
thus
to
pass
the
time
and
deal
with
them
than
now
to
make
any
express
refusal
either
of
the
King’s
said
entree
or
else
to
delay
to
common
and
treat
upon
the
same
nam
inter
tractandum
varia
occurrere
et
incidere
possint
que
rem
ut
tua
prudentia
facile
perspicit
citra
suspitionem
differe
et
protelare
queant

It
is
somewhat
to
my
marvel
that
the
King’s
Highness
as
I
have
by
mine
other
letters
signified
unto
you
makes
difficult
for
the
lending
of
the
Peter
Pumgarnet
to
the
ambassador
of
France
considering
the
manifold
good
deserts
of
the
said
ambassador
and
the
great
profit
and
commodity
that
shall
arise
unto
his
Grace
thereby

And
in
my
judgement
it
is
not
to
be
suspected
or
feared
that
she
shall
or
may
be
used
by
the
said
ambassador
against
the
King’s
Highness
in
any
hostility
considering
that
the
sureties
shall be
bound
as well
for
that
point
as
for
her
redelivery
at
the
year's
end
and
then
there
is
more
lightness
of
straighter
collection
with
France
than
of
any
breach

And
where
as
your
letters
purposes
that
the
King’s
Highness
may
have
five
hundred
marks
for
the
loan
of
the
said
ship
besides
the
advantage
of
his
customs
of
his
own
subjects
and
thereunto
it
is
to
be
considered
that
the
customs
of
the
strangers
amounts
far
above
the
customs
of
his
own
subjects

Wherever
for
one
hundred
pound
paid
by
the
Englishmen
the
strangers
pays
nine
hundred

Besides
this
I
suppose
if
the
King
have
for
the
loan
of
her
five
hundred
marks
his
Grace
must
new
rig
trim
and
tackle
her
at
his
own
cost
and
charge
which
percase
will
surmount
the
same
of
the
said
five
hundred
marks
whereas
the
Ambassador
offers
to
do
the
same
at
his
own
proper
express
cost
and
charge

Moore
than
this
I
cannot
say
remitting
all
to
the
King’s
noble
pleasure
and
gratitude
most
humbly
beseeching
his
grace
to
have
consideration
of
such
good
office
as
the
said
ambassador
has
and
daily
may
do
for
the
advancement
of
his
present
affairs

You
may
show
unto
his
Grace
that
I
would
suffer
none
of
them
to
pass
out
of
his
Mint
and
be
current
unto
such
time
as
his
Grace
had
seen
the
print
and
faction
of
the
same
and
his
pleasure
notified
unto
me
thereupon
accordingly

And
where
as
you
have
notified
unto
me
that
the
King’s
pleasure
is
that
his
Grace's
answer
to
Luther’s
letter
should
be
immediately
sent
forth
to
the
princes
of
Allemagne
without
abiding
or
tarrying
for
the
copy
thereof
I
think
therein
that
me seems
it
is
not
convenient
that
this
should
be
done
in
my
poor
opinion
as well
for
that
Luther
who
is
full
of
subtlety
and
craft
hereafter
might
percase
deny
that
any
such
letter
has
been
sent
by
him
unto
the
King’s
Highness
as
that
the
said
answer
not
having
the
said
copy
adjoined
thereunto
should
be
for
want
thereof
to
the
readers
and
hearers
thereof
somewhat
diminute
and
obscure
and
not
perfectly
perceived
by
them
that
shall
read
the
same

My
Lord
in
my
most
humblest
wise
that
my
poor
heart
can
think
I
do
thank
your
Grace
for
your
kind
letter
and
for
your
rich
and
goodly
present
the
which
I
shall
never
be
able
to
deserve
without
your
great
help
of
the
which
I
have
hitherto
had
so
great
plenty
that
all
the
days
of
my
life
I
am
most
bound
of
all
creators
next
the
King’s
Grace
to
love
and
serve
your
Grace
of
the
which
I
beseech
you
never
to
doubt
that
ever
I
shall
vary
from
this
thought
as
long
as
ony
breath
is
in
my
body

And
as
touching
your
Grace’s
trouble
with
the
suit
I
thank
our
Lord
that
them
that
I
desired
and
prayed
for
are
escaped
and
that
is
the
King
and
you

Not
doubting
but
that
God
has
preserved
you
both
for
great
causes
known
allonly
of
his
high
wisdom

And
as
for
the
coming
of
the
Legate
I
desire
that
much
and
if
it
be
God’s
pleasure
I
pray
him
to
send
this
matter
shortly
to
a
good
end
and
then
I
trust
my
Lord
to
recompense
part
of
your
great
pains
the
which
I
must
require
you
in
the
mean
time
to
accept
my
good
will
in
the
stead
of
the
power
the
which
must
proceed
partly
from
you
as
our
Lord
knows
to
whom
I
be
such
to
send
you
long
life
with
continuance
in
honour

Written
with
the
hand
of
her
that
is
most
bound
to
be
Your
humble
and
obedient
servant
ANNE
BOLEYN

Devised
to
be
sent
unto
Master
More

I
understand
by
Sir
William
a
Parre
that
the
King’s
Grace
demanded
of
you
and
Doctor
Stevyns
whether
you
thought
it
convenient
that
the
Duke
of
Richmont
should
learn
Greek
and
Latin
both
at
once
and
that
both
you
and
the
said
Doctor
duly
approve
mine
opinion
in
that
behalf

Wherefore
I
do
most
humbly
thank
you
assuring
you
that
for
my
discharge
in
that
behalf
I
have
not
only
demanded
the
opinions
of
Horman
Gonnell
Ryghtwyse
and
all
such
as
I
thought
could
any
thing
Instruct
me
how
I
should
best
acquit
me
in
the
charge
committed
unto
me
but
I
have
all
so
diligently
read
Quintiliane
Maphes
Vegius
Otho
Moguntinus
Baptista
Guarinus
and
especially
Erasmus
which
all
as
you
know
agree
in
that
thing

But
I
remember
that
you
showed
me
once
how
a
little
Latin
should
serve
so
the
said
Duke
might
have
French
and
to
be
plain
with
you
me
thinks
that
our
schavyn
folk
would
in
no
wise
he
should
be
learned

Which
I
assure
you
were
a
great
pity
for
on
my
faith
I
knew
never
a
more
singular
wit
neither
rich
nor
poor
than
he
has
and
all
be
it
that
he
has
already
and
every
day
shall
have
more
and
more
sundry
callers
upon
him
to
bring
his
mind
from
learning
some
to
here
a
cry
at
a
hare
some
to
kill
a
buck
with
his
bow
sometime
with
greyhounds
and
sometime
with
buckhounds
and
that
it
is
not
lawful
to
depart
till
he
have
taken
the
same
some
to
see
a
flight
with
a
hawk
some
to
ride
a
horse
which
yet
he
is
not
greatly
cumbered
with
because
of
his
youth
besides
many
other
devices
found
within
the
house
when
he
can
not
go
abroad
yet
I
trust
so
you
be
especial
good
master
to
me
to
bring
him
to
that
learning
that
you
shall be
contented
worthily
to
approve
but
I
beseech
you
if
any
that
is
learned
shall
fortune
to
cum
hither
by
whom
you
may
sufficiently
be
instructed
whether
my
rapport
of
him
be
true
or
not
that
you
will
than
after
your
best
manner
confirm
the
King’s
Grace
in
the
good
opinion
that
he
has
all
ready
to
have
him
learned

And
to
make
the
child
love
learning
I
never
put
him
in
fear
of
any
manner
correction
nor
never
suffer
him
to
continue
at
any
time
till
he
should
be
wearied
but
devise
all
the
ways
I
can
possible
to
make
learning
pleasant
to
him
in
so
much
that
many
times
his
officers
know
not
whether
I
learn
him
or
play
with
him
and
yet
have
I
all
ready
brought
him
to
have
a
right
good
understanding
in
the
principles
of
the
grammars
both
of
Greek
and
Latin
and
I
have
read
him
an
egloga
(
the
first
of
Virgile
and
2
of
the
first
scenes
of
Adelphorum
which
he
can
pronounce
right
prettily
but
I
find
Quintiliane
and
Herasmus
true
for
the
barbarous
tongue
of
him
that
taught
him
his
mattens
is
and
has
been
a
great
hindrance
to
me

I
do
therefore
most
instantly
require
you
that
when
you
shall
see
your
times
convenient
you
will
nyt
saff
to
move
the
King’s
Grace
that
the
said
my
Lord
of
Rychemont
may
be
brought
up
in
learning
assuring
you
that
God
has
given
him
a
great
aptness
both
to
learning
and
all
manner
such
qualities
as
should
become
such
noble
parson
to
have
which
in
my
mind
were
great
pity
but
that
it
should
be
employed
to
the
best
effect
where
in
I
shall
ever
do
my
best
according
as
for
his
age
shall be
requisite
and
all
be
it
that
some
here
which
be
high
schavyn
murmur
against
it
and
after
putting
off
many
parellys
let
not
to
say
that
learning
is
a
great
hindrance
and
displeasure
to
a
noble
man
I
hear
them
with
Ulysses’
ears
praying
you
as
time
shall
seem
to
you
convenient
to
tell
another
tale
to
the
King’s
Grace
and
my
Lord
Cardinal
thinking
verily
that
you
shall
there
in
do
a
greater
good
deed
than
you
went
off
beseeching
God
to
send
you
good
live
and
long
and
when
your
daughters
disputed
in
philosophy
afore
the
King’s
Grace
I
would
it
had
been
my
fortune
to
be
present

To
master
Thomas
Cromwell
one
of
his
Majesty's
Privy
Council
Sir
Thomas
More
Knight

Right
worshipful
after
hearty
commendations
so
It
is
that
I
am
informed
that
there
is
a
bill
put
up
against
me
into
the
higher
house
before
the
Lords
concerning
my
communication
with
the
nun
of
Canterbury
and
my
writing
unto
her
whereof
I
not
a
little
mervail
the
truth
of
the
matter
being
such
as
grace
and
I
know
and
as
I
have
plainly
declared
unto
you
by
my
former
letters
wherein
I
found
you
then
so
good
that
I
am
now
bold
upon
the
same
goodness
to
desire
you
to
show
me
the
favour
that
I
might
by
your
means
have
a
copy
of
my
bill
which
seen
if
I
find
any
untrue
surmise
therein
I
may
make
my
humble
suit
unto
the
King’s
good
Grace
to
declare
the
truth
either
to
his
Grace
or
by
his
Grace's
commandment
to
any
when
he
shall
please
for
I
am
so
clear
herein
that
I
nothing
mistrust
his
Graces
favour
towards
me
nor
the
judgement
of
any
honest
man

By
the
hand
of
heartily
all
your
own
Thomas
More
knight

Madame
in
the
best
manner
that
I
can

recommend
me
unto
your

to
my
good
lord
your
husband
thanking
your

thank
your

for
the
great
pain
you
took
in

of

trust
now
mine
honourable
years

in
that

a
lady
to
furnish
my
room

stand
in

there
is
an
old
saying

men
live
long

Madam
I
think
long
till
I
see
you
for
and
I
were
at
Calais
again
I
would
no
more
take
on
me

a
suitor

Madam
as
to
good
Mistress
Stayninges

still
a
suitor
with
a
great
belly

I
have
pity
to
see
her
now

Madam
for
lack
of
a
good
pen
and
of

good
writer
I
fear
me
you
shall
have
much
work
to

my
hand

yours

Madame

to
hear
how

France
and
I
beseech
your

that
this
letter

Written
in

the
xxx
day
of

the
simple
hand
of
her

your

to
her
little
power

Dame
Elizabeth
Whethilll
To
the
right
honourable
my
lady
Lysle
at
Calais
It
may
like
your
Highness
to
call
to
your
gracious
remembrance
that
at
such
time
as
of
your
great
weighty
room
of
Chancellorship
(
unto
the
which
far
above
my
merits
your
Highness
of
your
incomparable
goodness
exalted
me
unto
you
were
so
good
and
gracious
unto
me
as
at
my
humble
suit
to
disburden
me
(
giving
me
licence
with
your
gracious
favour
to
bestow
the
residue
of
my
life
to
come
about
the
provision
of
my
soul
in
the
service
of
God)

It
pleased
your
Highness
further
to
say
unto
me
that
for
the
service
I
had
done
that
in
any
suit
I
should
have
hereafter
to
your
Grace
that
either
should
concern
mine
honour
or
appertain
to
my
profit
(
for
these
very
words
it
liked
your
Highness
to
use
to
me
I
should
find
your
Highness
my
good
and
gracious
Lord

So
it
is
now
gracious
Sovereign
that
worldly
honour
is
the
thing
whereof
I
have
resigned
both
the
possession
and
the
desire
in
the
surrender
of
your
honourable
office
and
as
for
worldly
profit
I
trust
experience
proves
and
daily
more
and
more
shall
prove
that
I
was
never
very
greedy
thereof

But
now
is
my
most
humble
suit
to
your
excellent
Highness
to
beseech
it
somewhat
to
tender
my
poor
honesty
albeit
principally
that
of
your
accustomed
goodness
no
sinister
information
can
otherwise
move
your
noble
Grace
to
have
any
mistrust
of
my
troth
and
devotion
towards
your
majesty
then
I
have
or
shall
give
just
cause
which
I
hope
there
is
none

Wherever
most
gracious
Sovereign
I
neither
will
nor
yet
can
it
well
become
me
with
your
Highness
to
reason
or
argue
the
matter
but
in
most
humble
manner
prostrate
at
your
Graces
feet
I
beseech
your
Majesty
with
your
own
high
prudence
and
accustomed
goodness
consider
and
weigh
the
matter

And
if
that
in
your
so
doing
your
own
virtuous
mind
shall
give
you
that
notwithstanding
your
manifold
goodness
that
your
Highness
has
used
towards
me
that
I
have
most
unnaturally
and
ungratefully
digressed
from
my
bound
duty
of
allegiance
towards
your
Majesty
then
desire
I
no
further
favour
at
your
Graces
hands
then
the
loss
of
all
I
may

Let
me
loose
goods
lands
liberty
and
finally
my
life

Albeit
if
in
the
considering
of
my
cause
your
high
wisdom
and
gracious
goodness
shall
perceive
that
I
have
not
otherwise
demeaned
my
self
then
may
well
stand
with
my
bound
duty
and
faithfulness
towards
your
Royal
Majesty
then
in
most
humble
manner
I
beseech
your
noble
Grace
that
the
knowledge
of
your
true
gracious
persuasion
in
that
behalf
may
relieve
the
torment
of
my
present
heaviness
conceived
of
the
dread
and
fear
(
by
that
I
hear
a
grievous
bill
put
up
by
your
learned
Council
unto
your
high
Court
of
Parliament
against
me
lest
your
Grace
might
by
some
sinister
information
be
moved
to
think
the
contrary

Which
if
your
Highness
do
not
(
as
I
trust
in
God
and
your
great
goodness
the
matter
by
your
wisdom
well
examined
you
will
not
then
in
most
humble
manner
I
beseech
your
Highness
further
since
your
Highness
has
here
before
of
your
mere
abundant
goodness
heaped
on
me
both
worship
and
honour
and
since
now
I
have
left
of
all
such
things
and
nothing
seek
or
desire
but
the
life
to
come
and
to
pray
for
your
Grace
the
while
that
it
may
like
your
Highness
of
your
accustomed
benignity
somewhat
to
tender
my
poor
honesty
and
never
to
suffer
any
man
by
means
of
such
a
bill
to
take
occasion
against
the
truth
to
slander
me
although
this
by
the
peril
of
their
own
souls
would
do
them
more
hurt
then
me
for
I
setle
my
heart
to
depend
upon
the
comfort
of
the
truth
and
the
hope
of
heaven
and
not
upon
the
fallible
opinion
of
some
changeable
persons

And
thus
most
dread
and
dear
sovereign
Lord
I
beseech
the
blessed
Trinity
*
preserve
your
noble
Grace
both
body
and
soul
and
all
that
are
your
well
willers
and
amend
the
contrary
among
whom
If
ever
I
be
or
ever
have
been
one
then
I
pray
God
that
he
may
with
my
open
shame
and
destruction
declare
it

Our
Lord
bless
you

My
dearly
beloved
Daughter
I
doubt
not
but
by
reason
of
the
King’s
Counsellors
resorting
hither
in
this
time
in
which
the
fathers
of
the
Chearter
house
and
some
others
be
judged
to
death
for
treason
may
hap
to
put
you
in
some
fear
for
me
especially
for
that
it
is
not
unlikely
but
that
you
have
hard
that
I
also
was
brought
before
them
I
thought
it
necessary
to
advertise
you
to
the
end
that
you
should
not
conceive
more
hope
then
the
matter
gives
or
more
grieve
then
the
present
occasion
ministers

I
was
offered
to
sit
down
with
them
but
in
no
wise
I
would

Master
Secretary
told
me
that
he
nothing
doubted
but
that
I
had
seen
the
new
statutes
made
the
last
sitting
of
the
Parliament

I
answered
you
verily
albeit
for
as
much
as
I
being
here
and
not
minding
to
meddle
with
Those
matters
any
more
I
thought
it
little
need
for
me
to
bestow
much
time
upon
them

He
asked
me
whether
I
had
read
the
first
statute
of
the
King’s
being
head
of
the
Church

I
answered
You

Then
his
masterhip
declared
unto
me
that
since
it
was
now
by
act
of
Parliament
ordained
that
his
Highness
and
his
heirs
is
and
was
and
perpetually
should
be
supreme
head
in
earth
of
the
Church
of
England
Immediately
under
Christ
the
King’s
pleasure
was
that
these
here
of
his
Counsel
assembled
should
demand
my
opinion
therein

Whereunto
I
answered
that
in
good
faith
I
had
well
trusted
that
his
Highness
would
never
have
commanded
any
such
question
to
be
asked
of
me
considering
that
I
ever
from
the
beginning
well
and
truly
declared
my
mind
to
his
Majesty
and
also
unto
your
Mastership
both
by
mouth
and
writing
and
now
I
have
discharged
my
mind
of
all
such
matters
meaning
not
hereafter
to
dispute
King’s
or
Popes
titles

I
am
the
King’s
faithful
subject
and
will be
and
daily
pray
for
him
and
all
his
Realm
and
otherwise
then
this
I
Intend
not
to
meddle

And
for
you
master
More
I
know
so
much
that
his
Grace
would
be
glad
to
see
you
take
such
conformable
ways
that
you
might
be
abroad
again
with
a
great
credit
and
worship
as
ever
you
were

Whereunto
I
answered
I
would
not
meddle
in
the
world
again
to
have
all
the
world
given
me
as
in
effect
I
answered
before

"
Then
was
I
commanded
to
go
forth
awhile
and
presently
called
in
again

Then
said
master
Secretary
unto
me
Though
you
are
a
prisoner
condemned
to
perpetual
imprisonment
yet
thereby
I
was
not
discharged
of
my
allegiance
to
his
Highness
and
whereupon
he
demanded
whither
I
thought
his
Highness
might
not
exact
a
direct
answer
of
me
of
such
things
as
might
be
demanded
as
of
any
other
I
answered
that
I
thought
his
Highness
might

Then
said
he
that
like
as
his
Highness
would
be
gracious
to
them
that
he
found
conformable
so
his
Grace
fully
determined
to
follow
the
course
of
the
law
towards
such
as
shall
show
themselves
wilful
and
obstinate
and
your
demeanour
In
this
matter
master
More
has
made
many
so
stiff
therein
as
they
be

Whereunto
I
answered
that
I
gave
no
man
occasion
neither
by
word
nor
writing
to
hold
on
the
one
side
or
the
other

And
for
conclusion
I
would
go
no
further
whatsoever
pain
should
me
befall

For
I
am
the
King’s
true
faithful
subject
and
beadsman

I
am
at
the
King’s
pleasure

I
would
to
God
my
death
would
do
him
good

Well
master
More
quoth
master
Secretary
report
shall be
made
to
his
Highness
and
his
gracious
pleasure
known
you
shall
hear
further

So
he
bade
me
farewell

And
so
to
my
Chamber
by
master
Lieutenant
I
was
brought
again

MY
LORD
As
I
gather
by
your
Letter
delivered
to
my
brother
Harbert
you
are
in
sum
fear
how
to
frame
my
lord
your
brother
to
speak
in
your
favour
the
denial
of
your
request
shall
make
his
folly
more
manifest
to
the
world
which
will
more
grieve
me
than
the
want
of
his
speaking

I
would
not
wish
you
importune
for
his
good
will
if
it
comes
not
frankly
at
the
first
it
shall be
sufficient
ones
to
have
require
it
and
after
to
cease

I
would
desire
you
might
obtain
the
King’s
Letters
in
your
favour
and
also
the
aid
and
furtherance
of
the
most
notable
of
the
Counsel
such
as
you
shall
think
convenient
which
thing
obtained
shall be
no
small
shame
to
your
brother
and
loving
sister
in
case
they
do
not
the
like

I
pray
you
let
me
have
knowledge
every
night
at
what
hour
you
will
come
that
your
porteress
may
wait
at
the
gate
to
the
fields
for
yow

And
thus
with
my
most
humble
and
hearty
recommendations
I
take
my
leave
of
you
for
this
time
giving
you
like
thanks
for
your
coming
to
the
court
when
I
was
there

From
Chelsey

I
will
keep
in
store
till
I
speak
with
you
my
lord
large
offer
for
Fausterne
at
which
time
I
shall be
glad
to
know
your
further
pleasure
therein

By
her
that
is
and
shall be
your
humble
true
and
loving
wife
during
her
life
KATHERIN
THE
QUEEN

K.
P

Sir
the
great
gentleness
of
you
so
manifestly
showed
toward
me
with
the
continuance
of
such
a
benevolent
mind
in
setting
forward
my
purpose
gives
me
yet
a
little
more
boldness
to
trouble
you
with
the
reading
of
this
scroll
beseeching
you
of
your
patience
therein
while
I
a
little
more
at
large
show
to
you
my
mind
and
purpose
the
which
I
had
thought
to
have
down
these
days
past
presently
before
you
if
I
might
have
found
you
at
a
convenient
leisure
to
the
hearing
of
the
same
for
gladly
I
would
that
you
should
a
little
more
plainly
know
with
what
heart
and
mind
I
would
serve
the
King
withal

And
first
for
as
much
that
you
may
peradventure
judge
that
I
moved
only
by
the
high
authority
wherein
it
has
pleased
the
King’s
Highness
most
worthily
to
set
you
so
much
desire
by
your
special
preferment
to
be
set
forward
to
the
King’s
service
now
at
this
time
I
shall
beseech
you
of
your
gentleness
not
to
take
me
so
for
albeit
that
by
your
authority
I
will
not
deny
I
am
somewhat
moved
indeed
yet
certainly
this
to
you
I
will
affirm
if
there
were
not
other
causes
joined
thereto
which
more
sharply
stir
and
prick
my
mind
than
does
that
I
being
to
you
so
unknown
as
I
am
would
never
have
tempted
nor
enterprised
such
a
purpose
with
you
for
if
I
had
not
found
at
such
time
as
I
first
saluted
you
at
home
a
singular
humanity
and
gentleness
in
you
and
if
I
had
not
much
heard
of
your
goodness
in
setting
forward
at
honest
purposes
you
and
if
I
had
not
seen
and
perceived
your
excellent
wisdom
and
your
other
virtues
most
worthy
of
all
high
authority
I
think
I
had
never
conceived
this
purpose
I
think
I
had
never
set
my
self
in
this
case
wherein
my
special
trust
is
more
to
be
to
you
bound
than
in
the
rest
of
my
life
with
any
service
I
can
deserve
for
of
this
I
assure
you
I
am
not
of
so
vile
and
base
of
stomach
as
for
to
obtain
and
benefit
worldly
to
desire
to
be
bound
to
any
man
whom
I
cannot
with
heart
and
mind
reverently
both
honour
and
love

First
here
in
Oxford
a
great
part
of
my
youth
I
occupied
my
self
in
the
study
of
philosophy
joining
thereto
the
knowledge
of
both
tongues
both
Latin
and
Greek
and
so
after
passed
over
in
to
Italy
whereas
I
so
delighted
in
the
contemplation
of
natural
knowledge
--
wherein
the
most
part
of
men
lettered
there
occupy
themselves
--
that
many
times
I
was
purposed
to
have
spent
the
rest
of
my
life
wholly
therein
till
at
the
last
moved
by
Christian
charity
philosophy
set
apart
I
applied
my
self
to
the
reading
of
holy
scripture
judging
all
other
secret
knowledge
not
applied
to
some
use
and
profit
of
other
to
be
but
as
a
vanity

Wherefore
in
the
study
of
holy
letters
certain
years
I
spent
after
the
which
because
my
purpose
then
was
to
live
in
a
political
life
I
set
my
self
now
these
last
years
past
to
the
knowledge
of
the
civil
Law
that
I
might
thereby
make
a
more
stable
and
sure
judgement
of
the
political
order
and
customs
used
among
us
here
in
our
country

After
this
manner
in
diverse
kinds
of
studies
I
have
occupied
my
self
ever
having
in
mind
this
end
and
purpose
at
the
last
here
in
this
community
where
I
am
brought
forth
and
borne
to
employ
them
to
some
use
and
though
in
them
I
have
not
most
profited
yet
diligence
and
will
has
not
lacked
thereto
but
what
so
ever
it
is
that
I
have
by
the
goodness
of
God
attained
unto
I
shall
most
gladly
after
your
judgement
and
advice
apply
it
to
the
service
of
our
prince
and
thereby
reckon
my
self
to
attain
a
great
part
of
my
felicity

Wherever
I
beseech
you
sir
as
you
of
your
only
goodness
have
begun
so
at
your
pleasure
and
convenient
leasure
to
help
forward
thus
my
purpose
and
then
shall
I
be
to
you
more
bound
than
I
am
yet
to
any
mortal

living

Sir
I
most
heartily
commend
me
unto
you
and
whereas
I
have
been
somewhat
slow
in
writing
since
I
arrived
hither
to
our
country
(
whereas
I
bear
the
air
better
than
I
did
with
you
in
Italy
I
will
now
my
slackness
therein
by
the
length
of
this
in
some
part
recompense
the
which
I
trust
shall
no
thing
offend
you
but
bring
to
you
great
pleasure
and
comfort

This
much
I
said
this
far
I
went
but
his
grace
not
satisfied
therewith
desiring
to
have
your
sentence
therein
plainly
declared
commanded
me
this
now
to
write
to
you
that
his
pleasure
was
that
you
should
like
a
learned
man
all
assertion
by
any
cause
rising
set
aside
in
those
2
causes
ponder
and
weigh
the
nature
of
the
things
as
they
be
in
them
self
and
putting
a-part
all
successes
and
dangerous
effects
which
of
them
may
ensue
leaving
all
such
things
to
his
grace’s
wisdom
and
his
policy
declare
your
sentence
truly
and
plain
without
colour
or
cloak
of
dissimulation
(
which
his
grace
most
princely
abhors
not
willing
you
of
these
things
to
make
any
great
volume
or
book
but
briefly
to
gather
the
most
effectual
reasons
which
in
your
stomach
be
of
most
weight
and
them
to
set
forth
after
your
plain
fashion
and
manner
of
writing
this
was
his
grace’s
pleasure
and
commandment
that
I
should
to
you
write
which
I
have
as
near
as
my
memory
would
serve
me
therein
truly
and
faithfully
now
to
you
exercised

now
sir
consider
and
prudently
weigh
how
princely
a
request
this
is
of
our
prince
and
then
I
am
sure
you
will
employ
your
self
with
all
diligence
and
study
to
satisfy
his
noble
desire
to
the
which
also
master
Secretary
(
whose
most
loving
goodness
towards
you
gives
place
to
no
man
mostly
gently
does
exhort
you
willing
you
also
in
any
case
what
so
ever
your
sentence
in
these
causes
shall
be
to
use
your
wont
and
customed
plains
with
prudent
simplicity
and
me
upon
his
behalf
this
to
certify
you
that
in
case
be
your
learning
and
judgement
in
these
matters
of
weight
would
stretch
and
extend
to
the
satisfying
of
the
King’s
desire
and
mind
that
then
your
return
hither
to
your
country
should
be
greatly
to
the
King’s
pleasure
to
your
own
comfort
and
much
profit
to
the
rest
of
your
friends
you
and
yet
further
if
so
be
that
your
knowledge
and
learning
would
not
serve
you
to
this
purpose
and
request
of
the
King
yet
notwithstanding
would
he
advise
you
of
a
tender
and
loving
mind
to
prepare
yourself
at
your
convenient
leasure
towards
your
country
doubting
no
thing
but
that
the
King’s
Highness
in
other
his
causes
and
his
affairs
shall
use
your
service
and
most
loving
and
servisable
mind

For
sorry
he
is
that
there
among
strangers
without
profit
to
your
country
your
virtues
should
be
so
utterly
drowned
and
like
as
in
a
dream
vanish
away

Whereby
Sir
you
may
plainly
perceive
the
gentleness
of
his
stomach
and
singular
goodness
to
all
men
of
honesty
which
to
you
almost
unacquainted
and
of
small
familiarity
bears
such
mind
moved
only
by
the
opinion
of
virtue
which
to
him
fame
has
reported
in
so
much
that
this
he
willed
me
now
by
my
letters
of
his
goodness
and
benevolent
mind
so
to
assure
you
that
in
all
such
things
as
might
touch
your
preferment
to
my
lady
your
mother
and
my
Lord
your
brother
whom
nature
so
straightly
binds
only
he
would
give
place
wherein
he
shows
so
gently
a
stomach
that
I
dare
this
boldly
now
say
that
if
ever
hereafter
it
shall be
your
chance
presently
here
of
this
mind
in
him
experience
to
take
you
shall
as
I
do
for
his
virtues
and
not
only
for
his
authority
have
him
in
stable
and
reverent
love
such
is
his
wisdom
and
in
matters
of
state
his
high
policy

and
thus
now
you
have
heard
the
most
prudent
advice
and
singular
benevolence
of
master
Secretary
to
the
which
I
doubt
not
but
that
with
great
gladness
you
will
apply
yourself
willing
thereby
to
satisfy
our
princes
pleasure
and
desire

And
now
Sir
for
because
since
our
last
departure
out
of
our
country
little
communication
concerning
these
matters
has
been
between
us
had
I
will
now
adjoin
these
few
words
unto
you

(
6
Ponder
you
well
this
levitical
law
and
how
it
is
rooted
in
the
law
of
nature
and
how
by
general
conseil
it
has
been
many
times
declared
and
authorised
thereby
and
further
how
upon
the
other
side
the
slenderness
of
this
long
usurped
and
abused
authority
of
the
pope
which
by
patience
of
princes
simplicity
of
the
people
and
ambitious
avarice
of
his
predecessors
in
process
of
time
by
little
and
little
is
grown
to
this
intolerable
iniquity
and
then
I
think
that
you
shall
see
in
these
causes
the
judged
truth
and
plain
equity

But
all
this
I
leave
to
your
own
consideration
and
judgement
praying
to
him
of
whom
to
all
men
comes
all
light
that
by
his
light
and
grace
you
may
see
the
truth
and
so
then
to
set
it
forth
that
it
may
be
comfort
to
our
prince
pleasure
to
your
self
and
to
all
other
here
your
lovers
and
friends

here
is
no
thing
down
without
due
order
and
reasonable
mean
here
is
touching
religion
nothing
almost
altered
at
all
but
that
which
was
of
all
other
most
necessary
which
is
as
I
trust
and
shall be
a
very
ground
and
a
foundation
to
civil
order
and
a
true
and
right
policy

this
is
the
state
here
and
of
this
one
thing
I
do
you
assure
if
I
had
found
truth
in
deed
these
things
which
by
misreport
there
with
you
were
commonly
said
as
that
our
prince
should
be
slipped
also
from
the
grounds
of
scripture
from
the
honour
of
the
sacraments
and
from
all
the
common
laws
and
wholesome
ceremonies
of
the
church
without
order
I
would
never
have
been
so
without
sense
or
stomach
of
an
honest
man
as
at
this
time
to
have
sought
to
enter
to
his
service
for
the
desire
which
I
have
long
nourished
in
my
breast
to
serve
this
our
master
and
prince
is
in
this
stable
and
I
trust
ever
shall be
in
his
service
to
serve
God
and
my
country
to
the
which
purpose
the
rest
of
my
life
I
will
now
dedicate
to
his
grace
and
with
such
heart
and
mind
serve
him
withal
as
is
convenient
to
a
true
faithful
and
Christian
subject
toward
his
most
noble
and
catholic
prince
this
is
my
mind
and
I
am
sure
the
same
is
yours
the
which
I
trust
in
facts
you
shall
have
place
shortly
to
declare
and
this
I
commit
you
to
God

At
London
the
15
of
February
By
yours
assured
Thomas
Starkey

Thomas
Starkey
to
his
friend
in
Italy
wishing
him
to
give
his
opinion
to
the
King’s
grace
touching
his
opinion
for
the
altering
of
religion
and
the
abolishing
of
the
pope's
authority

(
1
Sir

You
wrote
before
in
our
prince’s
cause
of
your
own
mission
wherein
you
showed
lovingly
the
dangers
that
might
of
his
cause
follow
but
the
matter
it
self
as
it
is
here
by
the
King
most
sharply
judged
you
did
not
almost
touch

Wherefore
now
the
King
as
I
have
written
requires
your
learned
judgement
and
that
you
should
leave
your
prudent
and
witty
policy
till
you
be
required

The
points
be
these
which
though
you
right
well
of
your
self
know
yet
I
will
put
them
a
little
after
my
mind
before
your
eyes

(
3
And
first
for
this
point
consider
how
this
law
is
rooted
in
nature
ponder
it
by
this
rule
if
it
seem
to
you
good
all
thing
which
binds
man
to
the
observation
thereof
all
law
written
put
aside
for
the
conservation
of
the
civil
political
life
universally
convenient
to
the
dignity
of
the
nature
of
man
all
such
I
think
is
rooted
in
the
law
of
nature

Apply
thys
rule
without
affection
and
with
a
right
you
examine
it
in
this
case

And
then
for
the
second
point
an
liceat
dispensare
easy
I
think
it
shall
be
to
find
the
pope’s
power
extends
not
thereto

And
though
it
were
expedient
for
the
wordly
policy
for
to
have
dispensation
as
it
was
peradventure
in
the
King’s
cause
yet
it
is
not
expedient
any
one
man
to
have
such
power
to
break
such
Law
so
rooted
in
nature
and
upon
this
ground
it
appears
to
me
further
that
the
pope
should
not
have
power
not
only
to
dispense
with
any
law
so
rooted
in
nature
but
also
that
he
has
not
power
(
nor
convenient
it
is
that
he
should
have
yes
though
he
were
made
head
of
the
church
power
to
dispense
with
laws
made
in
general
conseil
catholic
laws
and
universal
grounds
ordained
for
the
conservation
of
Christian
life
in
all
Christ’s
church
and
though
he
has
used
the
contrary
it
was
I
think
a
misuse
and
usurped
by
the
reason
whereof
now
it
is
spied
now
it
does
fall
now
it
is
plucked
justly
away

Look
also
and
ponder
this
whether
ever
the
whole
authority
of
making
of
abrogating
of
dispensing
with
catholic
laws
and
universal
grounds
of
Christian
living
were
ever
given
and
translated
to
the
pope
by
any
law
written
in
general
counsel
which
were
necessary
to
find
if
we
should
attribute
such
authority

as
to
the
emperor’s
we
find
legem
regiam
qua
potestas
senatus
and
populi
erat
in
principem
collata

(
4
The
second
principal
matter
-
an
superioritas
quam
multis
in
seculis
romanus
pontifex
sibi
vindicavit
sit
ex
iure
divino

Here
you
must
weigh
the
places
of
the
gospel
and
scripture
wherein
I
think
you
shall
find
non
manifestly
proving
that
the
common
places
you
know
how
that
they
are
understood
contrary
thereby
diverse
and
many
as
when
the
disciples
of
Christ
contended
for
superiority
you
know
what
Christ
said
you
know
how
Paul
confesses
he
knows
only
Christ
for
heed
civil
and
political
heeds
he
confessed
many
sed
iure
divino
nullum

(
5
Look
further
how
the
Greeks
fell
from
the
church
catholic
as
we
call
now
chiefly
for
because
the
bishop
of
Rome
would
be
chief
head
you
know
what
is
to
be
given
to
the
judgement
of
the
Greeks
in
the
interpretation
of
scripture
better
than
I
do

The
contention
between
Peter
and
Paul
takes
away
such
superiority
as
is
given
to
the
successors
of
Peter
Ponder
why
more
from
the
bishop
of
Antioch
than
of
Rome
such
superiority
is
taken
away
seeing
Peter
was
bishop
of
both

(
6
These
certain
points
I
now
write
to
you
non
quia
preiudicium
aliquod
afferrent
the
King’s
pleasure
is
that
you
should
without
any
prejudicial
affection
taken
of
any
man
upon
one
part
or
other
with
a
sincere
mind
and
with
that
light
that
God
has
given
you
in
scriptures
and
learning
give
your
sentence

And
as
touching
the
policy
of
both
the
matters
and
of
bringing
them
to
effect
which
his
grace
has
now
done
whether
it
be
well
done
or
if
he
requires
no
judgement
of
you
as
of
one
that
in
such
things
has
no
great
experience
as
yet

As
whether
it
be
convenient
that
there
should
be
one
head
in
the
church
and
that
to
be
the
bishop
of
Rome
set
this
aside
and
in
his
cause
of
matrimony
whether
the
policy
that
he
has
used
therein
be
profitable
to
his
realm
or
no
leave
that
aside
only
show
you
whether
if
the
first
matrimony
were
to
make
whether
you
would
approve
that
then
or
no
and
the
cause
why
you
would
not
and
thus
weigh
the
thing
in
it
self
as
it
is
in
his
own
nature
and
put
a
part
fear
of
all
dangers
hope
of
all
good
which
should
succeed
and
hangs
upon
worldly
policy
and
so
clearly
without
affection
either
of
King
or
Queen
bravely
give
your
sentence

And
thus
you
shall
first
honour
God
and
truth
and
second
also
satisfy
the
King
which
said
to
me
these
words
that
rather
he
had
you
were
buried
there
than
you
should
for
any
worldly
promotion
and
profit
to
your
self
dissemble
with
him
in
these
great
and
weighty
causes

Thus
you
have
my
mind
and
the
King’s
pleasure
withal
and
if
case
be
that
you
reach
to
the
judged
truth
you
need
not
to
fear
after
my
mind
that
men
should
lay
to
you
lightness
of
mind
and
changing
of
sentence
for
as
far
as
I
can
conjecture
you
did
affirm
nothing
in
the
cause
as
was
convenient
for
arrogance
it
any
thing
affirm
but
only
that
which
by
the
word
of
God
we
have
declared
to
us
wherefore
you
did
only
put
before
his
yes
the
dangers
which
hanged
upon
worldly
policy

If
I
remember
this
you
do
I
can
not
well
tell
for
I
never
see
nor
read
your
book
but
ones
as
you
know
well
at
the
which
time
it
seemed
to
me
you
wrote
so
probably
that
it
put
me
in
a
fear
of
dangers
to
come
but
I
trust
the
goodness
of
God
and
providence
of
our
most
wise
prince
shall
avert
and
turn
all
such
calamity
by
man’s
conjecture
foreseen
from
this
our
country

In

not
that
you
to

King’s
Highness

for
me
you
know

I
had
licence

depart
from
you

get
not
withstanding
my
conscience
might
not
be
so
satisfied

I
thought
to
visit
the
said
reverend
father
to
know
the
truth
whether
father
Iohan
Batmanson
did
impetrate
for
me
of
the
general
chapter
the
licence
that
Dane
George
has

The
truth
is
that
when
Dane
George
was
dispensed
with
the
religion
I
and
another
was
dispensed
with
all
/
considering
I
can
not
nor
never
could
live
solitary
/
and
I
amongst
you
intrused
in
a
close
air
/
might
never
have
my
health

Also
I
was
received
amongst
you
under
age
contrary
to
your
statutes
/
Wherefore
now
I
am
clearly
discharged
not
having
the
bishop
of
Rome’s
dispensation
but
you
that
received
me
to
the
religion
for
leavefull
and
lawful
causes
considered
/
have
dispensed
with
me

In
witness
that
I
do
not
fable
with
you
specially
that
you
be
in
all
causes
obedient
to
your
King

Right
honourable
and
my
especial
good
Lady
my
duty
done
I
recommend
me
unto
your
ladyship
trusting
to
Almighty
God
ye
are
yn
good
health
and
all
your
children

And
madame
a
little
before
Christmas
I
desired
Sir
Richard
Greynfyld
to
speak
to
Mr.
Trogyn
for
my
husband's
land
and
he
said
he
will be
very
glad
to
do
it
and
so
Sir
Richard
Greynfyld
wrote
Mr.
Trogyn
a
letter
for
my
husband
and
then
Mr.
Trogyn
wrote
a
letter
to
Sir
Richard
Greynfyld
again
and
said
in
his
letter
again
that
Sir
Rychard
Greynfyld
and
Sir
John
Chamond
should
order
him
in
this
matter

And
then
said
Sir
Richard
Greynfyld
After
Christmas
I
will
ride
west
to
the
Mount
and
speak
with
sir
Trogyn
for
the
same
matter
and
to
be
at
Thyrreloff´s
point
with
him.'
And
so
after
Christmas
I
sent
one
to
Sir
Richard
Greynfyld
and
desired
him
according
to
his
own
promise
that
he
will
speak
with
Mr.
Trogyn
and
then
that
he
made
us
answer
that
he
will
not
meddle
no
further
therein

And
so
madam
without
your
gracious
help
and
succour
my
husband
and
I
are
never
like
to
have
your
lands
again
and
thus
we
be
driven
from
year
to
year

Alas
madame
have
some
remembrance
upon
us
and
thus
doing
ye
bind
me
to
be
your
bead
woman
for
ever

And
thus
I
beseech
Jesus
to
send
you
long
life
and
honour

To
my

good
lady
Lysle
these
be
delivered
in
Calais

After
humble
salutation
with
due
reverence

According
to
my
promise
by
my
letters
made
at
Bordeaux
and
also
at
London
this
present
month
directed
to
your
mastership
I
Andrew
Boorde
sometime
monk
of
the
charterhouse
of
London
am
come
to
your
mastership
commending
me
fully
in
to
God’s
hands
and
yours
to
do
with
me
what
you
will

As
I
wrote
to
your
mastership
I
brought
letters
from
beyond
sea
but
I
have
not
nor
will
not
deliver
them
unto
the
time
you
have
seen
them
and
knowing
the
overplus
of
my
mind

I
have
sufficient
record
that
the
prior
of
charterhouse
of
London
last
being
of
his
own
mere
motion
gave
me
licence
to
depart
from
the
religion
whereupon
I
went
over
see
to
school
and
now
I
did
come
home
by
the
grand
charterhouse
where
I
was
dispensed
of
the
religion
in
the
prior
Batmanson’s
days

at
the
said
house
in
the
renewing
that
licence
I
brought
a
letter
you
to
do
with
me
and
it
what
you
will
for
I
will
hide
no
thing
from
you
be
it
with
me
or
against
me

I
was
also
15

years
passed
dispensed
with
the
religion
by
the
bishop
of
Rome
bulls
to
be
suffrygan
of
Chichester
the
which
I
never
did
execute
the
auctore
yet
all
this
not-withstanding
I
submit
my-self
to
you
and
if
you
will
have
me
to
that
religion
I
shall
do
as
well
as
I
can
God
securing
who
ever
keep
your
mastership
in
prosperous
health
and
honour

I
resort
to
the
Scottish
King’s
house
and
to
the
Earl
of
Aryn
named
Hamylton
and
to
the
Lord
Evyndale
named
Stuerd
and
to
many
lords
and
lardes
as
well
spiritual
as
temporal
and
truly
I
know
their
minds
for
they
take
me
for
a
Scottish
man’s
son

For
I
name
my
self
Karre
and
so
the
Karres
calls
me
cousin
through
the
which
I
am
in
the
more
favour

Shortly
to
conclude
trust
you
no
Scott
for
they
will
use
flattering
words
and
all
is
falsehood

I
suppose
verily
that
you
have
in
England
beyond
10
thousand
Scots
and
innumerable
other
aliens
which
do
(
specially
the
Scots
much
harm
to
the
King’s
liege
men
through
their
evil
words

For
as
I
went
through
England
I
met
and
was
in
company
of
many
rural
fellows
English
men
that
love
not
our
gracious
King

would
to
Jesus
that
some
were
punished
to
give
other
example

would
to
Jesus
that
you
had
never
an
alien
in
your
realm
specially
Scots
for
I
never
knew
alien
good
to
England
except
they
knew
profit
and
lucre
should
come
to
them
etc.

In
all
the
parts
of
Christendom
that
I
have
travelled
in
I
know
not
5
English
men
inhabiers
except
only
scholars
for
learning

You
have
my
heart
and
shall be
sure
of
me
to
the
uttermost
of
my
poor
power
for
I
am
never
able
to
make
you
amends
for
where
I
was
in
great
thraldom
both
bodily
and
ghostly
you
of
your
gentleness
set
me
at
liberty
and
clearness
of
conscience

Also
I
thank
your
mastership
for
your
great
kindness
that
you
showed
me
at
Bishops
Waltam
and
that
you
gave
me
licence
to
come
to
you
once
in
a
quarter

As
soon
as
I
come
home
I
pretend
to
come
to
you
to
submit
my
self
to
you
to
do
with
me
what
you
will

for
for
lack
of
wit
peradventure
I
may
in
this
writing
say
that
shall
not
content
you
but
God
be
my
judge
I
mean
truly
both
to
my
sovereign
Lord
the
King
and
to
you

When
I
was
kept
in
thraldom
in
the
charterhouse
and
knew
neither
the
King’s
noble
acts
nor
you
then
stultitiously
through
sinistral
words
I
did
as
many
of
that
order
does
but
after
that
I
was
at
liberty
manifestly
I
perceived
the
ignorance
and
blindness
that
they
and
I
war
in
for
I
could
never
know
no
thing
of
no
manner
of
matter
but
only
by
them
and
they
would
cause
me
write
full
incipiently
to
the
prior
of
London
when
he
was
in
the
tower
before
he
was
put
to
execution
for
the
which
I
trust
your
mastership
has
pardoned
me
for
God
knows
I
was
kept
in
person
straightly
and
glad
I
was
to
write
at
their
request
but
I
wrote
nothing
that
I
thought
should
be
against
my
prince
nor
you
nor
no
other
man

I
pray
God
that
you
may
provide
a
good
prior
for
that
place
of
London
for
truly
there
are
many
wilful
and
obstinate
young
men
that
stand
too
much
in
their
own
concept
and
will
not
be
reformed
but
play
the
children
and
a
good
prior
would
to
serve
them
like
children

News
I
have
to
write
to
you
but
I
pretend
to
be
with
you
shortly
for
I
am
half
very
of
the
barren
country
as
Jesus
Christ
knows
who
ever
keep
you
in
health
and
honour

from
Leth
a
mile
from
Edinborough
the
first
day
of
April
by
the
hand
of
your
poor
scholar
and
servant
directed
on
back
Andrew
Boorde
Priest

I
desire
your
Lordship
to
continue
my
good
Lord
as
ever
you
have
been
for
God
be
my
judge
if
I
know
what
I
might
do
that
might
be
acceptable
to
you
I
would
do
it
for
there
is
no
creature
living
that
I
do
love
and
fear
so
much
as
you
and
I
have
not
in
this
world
no
refuge
but
only
to
you

when
I
came
to
London
out
of
Scotland
and
that
it
pleased
you
to
call
me
to
you
as
you
came
riding
from
Westminster
I
had
2
horses
stolen
from
me
and
I
can
tell
the
persons
that
has
bought
them
but
I
can
not
recover
my
horses
although
they
that
bought
them
did
never
toll
for
them
nor
never
buy
them
in
no
market
but
privately

Also
there
be
in
London
certain
persons
that
owes
me
in
money
and
stuff
53
pounds
the
which
my
friends
gave
me

I
do
ask
my
duty
of
them
and
they
call
me
'apostata
and
all
to
nothing'
and
say
they
will
trouble
me
and
do
slander
me
behind
my
back
of
things
that
I
should
do
20
years
ago
and
truly
they
can
not
prove
it
nor
I
never
did
it
the
matter
is
that
I
should
be
conversant
with
women
other
matters
they
lay
not
to
my
charge

I
desire
you
to
be
good
Lord
to
me
for
I
will
never
complain
further
than
to
you

I
thank
Jesus
Christ
I
can
live
although
I
never
have
penny
of
it
but
I
would
be
sorry
that
they
that
have
my
good
should
have
it
if
any
of
your
servants
could
get
it
I
would
give
it
to
them

your
faithful
servant
master
Walter
Thomas
dwelling
in
Wrettyll
knows
all
the
whole
matter
and
so
does
his
son
dwelling
in
the
temple

I
commit
all
to
you
to
do
with
me
and
it
what
it
shall
please
you
desiring
you
to
spare
my
rude
writing
for
I
do
presume
to
write
to
you
upon
your

unto

whereof
I
have
advertised
the

such

a

my

seen
that

the
chief
charge
and
is
put
in

above

active

timely
to
foresee

cause

the

of
such
provision
that
is
within
the
pale
and
marches
of
the
said
town
it
were
well
done
you
should
cause
without
any
rumour
or
bruit
as much
thereof
as
were
meat
to
be
brought
into
the
town
for
the
safeguard
thereof
and
the
better
furnishment
of
the same

his
appearance
at
all
times
when
he
shall be
called
for
by
the
King’s
Highness
or
any
of
his
honourable
council
you
suffer
him
to
go
at
liberty
Mr.
Wallop
after
my
right
hearty
commendations
where
the
King’s
Majesty
has
received
certain
advertisements
from
a
very
good
place
which
his
Majesty
thinks
does
much
touch
his
good
brother
the
French
King

And
that
it
were
very
expedient
he
had
knowledge
of
the
same

His
Highness
has
thought
convenient
to
write
the
same
unto
you
to
the intent
you
may
declare
them
to
the
Queen
of
Navarre
which
his
Highness
would
you
should
do
at
your
first
opportunity

The
particulars
be
these

First
his
Majesty
is
advised
that
the
Constable
and
Cardinal
of
Lorrien
shall
at
their
coming
in
to
Flanders
rather
be
entertained
with
cheer
to
show
an
appearance
of
amity
than
grow
to
any
conclusion
of
things
according
to
the
French
King’s
desire

Second
it
is
advertised
how
the
legate
for
Farneze
by
his
Governor
Marsselles
did
move
the
French
King
lately
by
the
bishop
of
Rome’s
commandment
to
make
difficulty
a
while
in
his
conclusion
between
him
and
the
Emperor
saying
that
the
necessity
of
the Emperor
should
thereby
cause
him
to
have
what
he
would
desire
Whereunto
the
French
King
should
answer
that
if
the Emperor
would
live
as
he
does
in
peace
and
friendship
he
would
do
his
best
always
to
show
like
correspondence

But
if
he
would
treat
any
further
thing
it
must
be
for
all
dependants
or
else
nothing

The
latter
end
of
his
saying
that
is
to
say
the
French
King’s
answer
only
was
secretly
reported
to
the Emperor

Now
you
may
require
Madame
de
Navarre
to
consider
what
these
things
do
savour
and
in
case
she
shall
think
that
the
knowledge
of
them
may
anything
confer
to
the
French
King’s
benefit
she
may
open
the
same
at
her
pleasure
and
by
one
point
she
may
presently
know
whether
any
of
the
rest
be
like
to
be
true
that
is
by
the
words
spoken
by
the
French
King
himself
touching
the
dependants
wherein
you
may
press
her
to
take
some
pains
to
know
the
certainty
as
a
means
to
way/weigh*
the
better
the
residue
albeit
his
Majesty
doubts
not
but
in
case
the
constable
do
not
grow
to
a
thorough
agreement
but
shall be
put
off
by
delays
new
inventions
and
devises

His
good
brother
the
French
King
shall
easily
by
the
same
convert
the Emperor’s
mind
and
purpose

And
what
answer
she
shall
presently
or
upon
deliberation
and
inquiry
make
unto
you
His
Majesty’s
pleasure
is
you
shall
advertise
with
convenient
diligence
joining
to
your
advertisements
such
other
occurrences
as
you
shall
there
learn
from
time
to
time
worthy
his
graces
knowledge

You
may
also
show
to
the
Queen
of
Navarre
that
in
like
manner
from
a
good
place
his
Majesty
is
advertised
that
in
Spain
they
begin
to
murmur
for
that
the Emperor
should
practise
the
marrying
for
himself
and
his
children
without
their
consents
saying
they
will
keep
a
parliament
upon
that
and
such
other
matters
whereupon
it
is
thought
he
will
send
thither
the
Duke
of
Alva
to
do
what
he
can
to appease
and
quiet
them
whereby
it
appears
that
were
it
not
only
for
the estimation
that
he
has
by
the
French
King
he
were
like
shortly
to
have
business
enough
to
turn
him
to

Thus
advising
you
that
the
King’s
Highness
is
in
good
health
with
all
your
friends
here
I
bid
you
heartily
well
to
fare

From
London
the
12
of
March
Endd

To
Mr.
Wallop
12th
marcij
To
my
cousin
Plumpton
of
Plumpton
this
deliver
with
speed

Cousin
Plumton
in
as
hearty
manner
as
I
can
think
I
recommend
me
to
you

I
have
viewed
Christall
the
rent
of
it
as
it
is
now
letted
10
shillings
4
pence
score
15
pounds
8
shillings
and
Arthington
is
above
20
pounds
at
the
end
of
16
years
the
will
be
3
score
pound
above
the
rent

And
the
woods
my
man
says
he
dare
give
a
thousand
mark
for
them
but
he
thinks
without
doubt
he
will
make
a
thousand
pounds

I
have
written
to
my
cousin
Henry
Savill
of
Lapset
to
go
through
with
my
Lord
of
Canterbury
for
it

According
to
the
communication
and
you
and
my
cousin
John
Gascoyne
shall
have
a
part
if
you
will
write
to
me
that
you
will
stick
to
it
and
Robert
Savill
and
Henry
Savill
of
Lapset
will
stand
to
two
parts

I
think
the
woods
will
give
us
our
money
and
more
and
the
lease
clear
to
be
gotten
for
laying
out
of
the
money
till
we
can
make
it
again
of
the
woods

I
have
sent
you
a
rental
of
it
what
it
is
every
close

I
pray
you
let
my
cousin
John
Gascoyne
see
this
letter
and
the
rental

Keep
it
secret
from
all
other

Your
assured
kinsman
Henry
Savill

Cousin
Gascoyne
your
children
are
merry

To
my
cousin
Plumpton
of
Plumptom
this
be
delivered

Cousin
Plumpton
I
recommend
me
to
you
and
as
I
perceive
by
my
son
Robert’s
servant
you
say
you
will
come
over
and
hunt
with
me
and
it
please
you
so
to
do
you
shall
be
as
heartily
welcome
as
any
man
that
came
here
of
a
good
space

You
shall
see
your
arrow
fly
and
your
greyhound
run
and
all
those
that
comes
with
you
winter
and
summer
when
it
please
you
to
come
as
long
as
I
live

As
for
the
other
matter
I
pass
not
a
little
of
it
I
have
yet
weighed
it
with
my
council
and
as
you
shall
know
at
our
meeting
as
I
am
informed
and
as
I
take
it
there
are
many
doubts
by
it

When
I
speak
with
you
I
will
hide
nothing
from
you
in
this
than
in
no
other
cause

When
you
intend
to
come
let
me
know
what
time
or
else
you
may
hope
neither
to
have
me
then
nor
my
son
at
home
but
my
wife
you
shall
be
sure
to
find
and
she
will
send
some
with
you
that
shall
let
you
see
both
rid
and
fallow
if
you
will
take
the
pain

Therefore
the
fault
is
in
you
and
not
in
me
you
may
amend
the
fault
when
it
pleases
you

The
cause
of
my
sending
of
my
servant
at
this
time
is
this
he
informs
me
that
in
your
country
there
is
a
man
that
can
kill
otters
very
well
wherefore
I
have
sent
him
to
get
him
to
me
for
a
week

I
assure
you
they
do
me
exceeding
much
harm
at
divers
places
and
especially
at
Woodkirk
and
Thornhill
and
lies
in
small
becks

My
folks
see
them
daily
and
I
can
not
kill
them
my
hounds
be
not
used
to
them

From
Sothill
the
8
of
November

By
your
assured
kinsman
Henry
Savill
knight

After
the
making
hereof
or
it
was
sealed
came
my
son
home
from
London

Of
Wednesday
came
my
Lord
of
Norfock
to
the
court

As
concerning
news
of
Scotland
give
credence
to
this
bearer

This
is
my
own
hand

To
my
right
worshipful
cousin
Mr.
William
Plumpton
of
Plumpton
esquire
this
deliver

Cousin
Plumpton
I
heartily
recommend
me
unto
you
thanking
you
for
all
your
goodness
at
all
times

I
have
received
your
letter
by
Roger
Brindell
and
where
that
you
write
there
is
no
doubts
if
the
matter
had
come
to
communication
you
are
the
man
that
I
trust
and
by
you
I
would
have
been
ordered
and
if
you
had
so
thought
I
would
have
confined
myself
to
you
But
I
perceive
the
part
is
not
minded
to
common
with
him
his
wife
thinks
him
to
light

And
I
think
consider
his
qualities
his
living
his
possibility
and
confer
all
together
I
think
as
good
chap
as
this
I
shall
get
a
living
for
him
both
as
good
and
as
fare

And
I
am
sure
there
has
been
comrades
won
with
other
far
wars
than
he
except
one
fault

And
as
for
that
there
is
and
has
been
many
good
men
with
that
fault
it
is
the
thing
that
he
cannot
amend

But
in
the
means
only
his
fault
so
shall
not
hurt
him
in
no
profits

Let
this
matter
pass
He
is
much
bound
to
you
and
if
ever
he
be
able
to
do
you
pleasure

I
trust
you
shall
see
him
get
a
living
ere
the
year
is
past

At
York
if
you
will
come
and
kill
a
hind
you
shall
be
heartily
welcome

Your
assured
kinsman
Henry
Savill

My
lord
after
my
hearty
commendations
these
shall
be
to
declare
to
you
that
according
to
your
accustomed
gentleness
I
have
received
six
warrants
from
you
by
your
servant
this
bearer
for
the
which
I
do
give
you
my
hearty
thanks
by
whom
also
I
have
received
your
letter
wherein
(
as
me
thought
I
perceive
strange
news
concerning
a
suit
you
have
in
hand
to
the
Queen
for
marriage
for
the
sooner
obtaining
whereof
you
seem
to
think
that
my
letters
might
do
you
pleasure

My
lord
in
this
case
I
trust
your
wisdom
doth
consider
that
if
it
were
for
my
nearest
kinsman
&
dearest
friend
on
life
of
all
other
creatures
in
the
world
it
stands
least
with
my
poor
honour
to
be
a
meddler
in
this
matter
considering
whose
wife
her
grace
was
of
late
and
besides
that
if
she
be
minded
to
grant
your
suit
my
letters
shall
do
you
but
small
pleasure

On
the
other
side
if
the
remembrance
of
the
King’s
majesty
my
father
(
whose
soul
God
pardon
will
not
suffer
her
to
grant
your
suit
I
am
nothing
able
to
persuade
her
to
forget
the
loss
of
him
who
is
as
yet
very
ripe
in
my
own
remembrance

Wherefore
I
shall
most
earnestly
require
you
(
the
premises
considered
to
think
non
unkindness
in
me
though
I
refuse
to
be
a
meddler
any
ways
in
this
matter
assuring
you
that
(
wowing
matters
set
apart
wherein
I
being
a
maid
am
nothing
cunning
if
otherwise
it
shall
lie
in
my
little
power
to
do
you
pleasure
I
shall be
as
glad
to
do
it
as
you
to
require
it
both
for
his
blood’s
sake
that
you
be
of
and
also
for
the
gentleness
which
I
have
always
found
in
you

As
knows
almighty
God
to
whose
tuition
I
commit
you

Cousin
Plumpton
I
heartily
recommend
me
unto
you

The
cause
of
my
writing
to
you
is
for
that
Roger
Ramy
said
to
me
he
thought
you
would
about
Low
Sunday
be
at
Thornhill

You
shall
come
to
a
old
house
clean
down
and
as
yet
little
amended

but
you
shall
be
welcome
as
I
can
think

I
would
be
sorry
that
you
should
take
pain
and
I
not
at
home
when
you
come

Tomorrow
begging
Thursday
I
must
of
force
ride
to
Tankerslay
8
miles
hence
and
meet
my
Lord
of
Shrewsburry
who
will
be
there
tomorrow
by
2
of
the
clock
and
see
a
shot
at
a
stag
as
my
keeper
has
sent
me
word

And
of
Monday
Tuesday
and
Wednesday
there
is
appointed
a
great
number
of
gentlemen
to
meet
at
Cocxs
at
Sheifield
where
I
intend
God
willing
to
be
and
every
night
will
lie
at
Tankerxlay
so
it
will
be
Friday
ere
I
come
to
Thornhill
which
is
the
18
(
14
of
May

Wherefore
I
desire
you
either
put
off
your
coming
to
that
day
or
take
so
much
pain
to
come
the
8
miles
to
Tankerxlay
where
I
have
no
lodging
but
you
shall
have
the
best
bed
the
keeper
has
and
you
shall
see
a
pollard
or
two
both
rid
and
fallow
and
see
all
our
good
cocks
fight
if
it
pleases
you
and
see
the
manner
of
our
cocking

And
whenever
you
come
I
require
you
take
time
to
hunt
with
me
for
one
week
bring
bows
and
greyhounds
and
at
the
time
of
the
year
hounds

A
pollard
is
sweet
now
and
I
love
it
best
now
at
this
season
and
by
Whitsunday
this
year
I
shall
have
fat
bucks

And
ere
any
red
dear
be
fat
it
will
be
July
as
far
as
my
experience
serves

Come
when
you
will
and
such
as
I
have
you
shall
see
and
bring
good
stuff
for
I
warn
you
they
are
wild
about
Tankerxlay
and
ill
to
catch
and
if
all
fail
I
have
that
are
tame
enough

I
make
all
these
brags
to
cause
you
to
come
for
I
never
yet
did
see
you
in
these
parts
and
you
shall
come
no
time
wrong
fencetime
than
other

I
have
time
plenty
lies
out
I
can
make
you
game
at
rid
and
fallow
and
stir
no
rascal

I
beseech
Jesus
send
us
merry
meeting

Thus
heartily
fare
you
well

My
Lord
having
received
your
Lordship’s
letters
I
perceive
in
them
your
goodwill
towards
me
because
you
declare
to
me
plainly
your
mind
in
this
thing
and
again
for
that
you
would
not
wish
that
I
should
do
any
thing
that
should
not
seem
good
unto
the
council
for
the
which
thing
I
give
you
most
hearty
thanks

And
whereas
I
do
understand
that
you
do
take
in
ivel
part
the
letters
that
I
did
write
unto
your
Lordship
I
am
very
sorry
that
you
should
take
them
so
for
my
mind
was
to
declare
unto
you
plainly
as
I
thought
in
that
thing
which
I
did
also
the
more
willingly
because
(
as
I
write
to
you
you
desired
me
to
be
plain
with
you
in
al
things

And
as
concerning
that
point
that
you
write
that
I
seem
to
stand
in
my
own
wit
in
being
so
well
assured
of
my
own
self
I
did
assure
me
of
my
self
no
more
than
I
trust
the
truth
shall
try
and
to
say
that
which
I
knew
of
my
self
I
did
not
think
should
have
displeased
the
council
or
your
Grace

And
surely
the
cause
why
that
I
was
sorry
that
there
should
be
any
such
about
me
was
because
that
I
thought
the
people
will
say
that
I
deserved
thought
my
lewd
demeanour
to
have
such
a
one
and
not
that
I
mislike
any
thing
that
your
Lordship
or
the
council
shall
think
good
for
I
know
that
you
and
the
council
are
charged
with
me
or
that
I
take
upon
me
to
rule
my
self
for
I
know
they
are
most
deceived
that
trust
most
in
themselves
wherefore
I
trust
you
shall
never
find
that
fault
in
me
to
the
which
thing
I
do
not
see
that
your
Grace
has
made
any
direct
answer
at
this
time
and
seeing
they
make
so
evel
reports
already
shall be
but
an
increasing
of
their
evil
tongues

Albeit
you
did
write
that
if
I
would
bring
forth
any
that
had
reported
it
you
and
the
council
would
see
it
redressed
which
thing
thought
I
can
easily
do
it
I
would
be
loath
to
do
it
for
because
it
is
my
own
cause
and
again
that
should
be
but
a
bridging
of
an
evil
name
of
me
that
am
glad
to
punish
them
and
so
get
the
evil
will
of
the
people
which
thing
I
would
be
loath
to
have

But
if
it
might
so
seem
good
unto
your
Lordship
and
the
rest
of
the
council
to
send
forth
a
proclamation
in
to
the
countries
that
they
refrain
their
tongues
declaring
how
the
tales
be
but
lies
it
should
make
both
the
people
think
that
you
and
the
council
have
great
regard
that
no
such
rumours
should
be
spread
of
any
of
the
King’s
Majesty’s
sisters
as
I
am
though
unworthy
and
also
I
should
think
myself
to
receive
such
friendship
at
your
hands
as
you
have
promised
me
although
your
Lordship
has
showed
me
great
already

Albeit
I
am
ashamed
to
ask
it
any
more
because
I
see
you
are
not
so
well
minded
thereunto

And
as
concerning
that
you
say
that
I
give
folks
occasion
to
think
in
refusing
the
good
to
uphold
the
evil
I
am
not
of
so
simple
understanding
nor
I
would
that
your
Grace
should
have
so
evil
an
opinion
of
me
that
I
have
so
little
respect
to
my
own
honesty
that
I
would
maintain
it
if
I
had
sufficient
promise
of
the
same
and
so
your
Grace
shall
prove
me
when
it
comes
to
the
point
And
thus
I
bid
you
farewell
desiring
God
always
to
assist
you
in
al
your
affairs

Your
assured
friend
to
my
little
power
ELIZABETH

To
my
very
good
Lord
my
Lord
Protector

Good
Sister
as
to
hear
of
your
sickness
is
unpleasant
to
me
so
is
it
nothing
fearful
for
that
I
understand
it
is
your
old
chest
that
is
wont
often
to
visit
you
whose
coming
though
it
be
oft
yet
is
it
never
welcome
but
notwithstanding
it
is
comfortable
for
that
"
jacula
praevisa
minus
feriunt

And
as
I
do
understand
your
need
of
Jane
Russel’s
service
so
am
I
sorry
that
it
is
by
my
man’s
occasion
let
which
if
I
had
known
before
I
would
have
caused
his
will
give
place
to
need
of
her
service
for
as
it
is
her
duty
to
obey
his
commandment
so
is
it
his
part
to
attend
your
pleasure
and
as
I
confess
it
were
meeter
for
him
to
go
to
her
since
she
attends
upon
you
so
indeed
he
required
the
same
but
for
that
divers
of
his
fellows
had
business
abroad
that
made
his
tarying
at
home

Good
Sister
though
I
have
good
cause
to
thank
you
for
your
often
sending
to
me
yet
I
have
more
occasion
to
render
you
my
hearty
thanks
for
your
gentle
writing
which
how
painful
it
is
to
you
I
may
well
guess
by
my
self
and
you
may
well
see
by
my
writing
so
often
how
pleasant
it
is
to
me

And
thus
I
end
to
trouble
you
desiring
God
to
send
you
as
well
to
do
as
you
can
think
and
wish
or
I
desire
or
pray

From
Hasherige
scribbled
this
27th
of
October

Your
loving
sister
ELIZABETH

And
thus
I
beseech
God
to
send
you
as well
to
fare
as
I
would
wish
my
self

At
Richmond
this
Thursday
night

Your
assured
loving
friend
during
my
life
MARY

Like
as
a
shipman
in
stormy
weather
plucks
down
the
sails
tarying
for
better
wind
so
did
I
most
noble
King
in
my
unfortunate
chance
a
Thursday
pluck
down
the
high
sails
of
my
joy
and
comfort
and
do
trust
one
day
that
as
troublesome
waves
have
repulsed
me
backward
so
a
gentle
wind
will
bring
me
forward
to
my
haven

Two
chief
occasions
moved
me
much
and
grieved
me
greatly
the
one
for
that
I
doubted
your
Majesty’s
health
the
other
because
for
all
my
long
tarying
I
went
without
that
I
came
for

Of
the
first
I
am
relieved
in
a
part
both
that
I
understood
of
your
health
and
also
that
your
Majesty’s
logging
is
far
from
my
Lord
Marquis’
chamber

Of
my
other
grief
I
am
not
eased
but
the
best
is
that
whatsoever
other
folks
will
suspect
I
intended
not
to
fear
your
grace’s
goodwill
which
as
I
know
that
I
never
deserved
to
faint
so
I
trust
will
still
strike
by
me

For
if
your
Grace’s
advice
that
I
should
return
(
whose
will
is
a
commandment
had
not
been
I
would
not
have
made
the
half
of
my
way
the
end
of
my
journey

Your
Majesty’s
humble
sister
to
commandment
ELIZABETH

To
the
King’s
most
excellent
Majesty

Like
as
the
richman
that
daily
gathers
riches
to
riches
and
to
one
bag
of
money
lays
a
great
sort
till
it
come
to
infinit
so
I
think
your
Majesty
not
being
sufficed
with
many
benefits
and
gentleness
showed
to
me
before
this
time
does
now
increase
them
in
asking
and
desiring
where
you
may
bid
and
command
requiring
a
thing
not
worthy
the
desiring
for
it
self
but
made
worthy
for
your
Highness’
request

My
picture
I
mean
in
which
if
the
inward
good
mind
toward
your
grace
might
as
well
be
declared
as
the
outward
face
and
countenance
shall
be
seen
I
would
nor
have
tarried
the
commandment
but
prevent
it
nor
have
been
the
last
to
grant
but
the
first
to
offer
it

For
the
face
I
grant
I
might
well
blush
to
offer
but
the
mind
I
shall
never
be
ashamed
to
present

For
though
from
the
grace
of
the
picture
the
colors
may
fade
by
time
may
give
by
whether
may
be
spotted
by
chance
yet
the
other
nor
time
with
her
swift
wings
shall
overtake
nor
the
misty
clouds
with
their
lowerings
may
darken
nor
chance
with
her
slippery
foot
may
overthrow

Of
this
although
yet
the
proof
could
not
be
great
because
the
occasions
has
been
but
small
notwithstanding
as
a
dog
has
a
day
so
may
I
perchance
have
time
to
declare
it
in
deeds
where
now
I
do
write
them
but
in
words

And
further
I
shall
most
humbly
beseech
your
Majesty
that
when
you
shall
look
on
my
picture
you
will
vouchsafe
to
think
that
as
you
have
but
the
outward
shadow
of
the
body
before
you
so
my
inward
mind
wishes
that
the
body
it
self
were
oftener
in
your
presence
albeit
because
both
my
so
being
I
think
could
do
your
Majesty’s
little
pleasure
though
my
self
great
good
and
again
because
I
see
as
yet
not
the
time
agreeing
thereunto
I
shall
learn
to
follow
this
saying
of
Horace
"
Feras
non
culpes
quod
vitari
non
potest

From
Hatfilde
this
15
day
of
May

Your
Majesty’s
most
humbly
sister
ELIZABETH

It
is
no
small
grief
to
me
to
perceive
that
they
whom
the
King’s
Majesty
my
father
(
whose
soul
God
pardon
made
in
this
world
of
nothing
in
respect
of
that
they
be
come
to
now
and
at
his
last
end
put
in
trusts
to
see
his
will
performed
whereunto
they
were
all
sworn
upon
a
book
it
grieves
me
I
say
for
the
love
I
bear
to
them
to
see
both
how
they
break
his
will
and
what
usurped
power
they
take
upon
them
in
making
(
as
they
call
it
laws
both
clean
contrary
to
his
proceedings
and
will
and
also
against
the
custom
of
all
Christendom
and
(
in
my
conscience
against
the
law
of
God
and
his
Church
which
passes
all
the
rest

But
though
you
among
you
have
forgotten
the
King
my
father
yet
both
God’s
commandment
and
nature
will
not
suffer
me
to
do
so
wherefore
with
God’s
help
I
will
remain
an
obedient
child
to
his
laws
as
he
left
them
till
such
time
as
the
King’s
Majesty
my
brother
shall
have
perfect
years
of
discretion
to
order
the
power
that
God
hath
sent
him
and
to
be
a
judge
in
these
matters
himself
and
I
doubt
not
but
he
shall
then
accept
my
so
doing
better
then
theirs
which
have
taken
a
piece
of
his
power
upon
them
in
his
minority

I
do
not
little
marvel
that
you
can
find
fate
with
me
for
observing
of
that
law
which
was
allowed
by
him
that
was
a
King
not
only
of
power
but
also
of
knowledge
how
to
order
his
power
to
which
law
all
you
consented
and
seemed
at
that
time
to
the
outward
appearance
very
well
to
like
the
same
and
that
you
can
could
find
no
fate
all
this
while
with
some
amongst
yourselves
for
running
half
a
year
before
that
which
you
now
call
a
law
ye
and
before
the
bishops
came
together
wherein
me
thought
you
do
me
very
much
wrong
if
I
should
not
have
asmuch
preeminence
to
continue
in
keeping
a
full
authorized
law
made
without
partiality
as
they
had
both
to
break
the
law
which
at
that
time
yourselves
must
needs
confess
was
of
full
power
and
strength
and
to
use
alterations
of
their
own
invention
contrary
both
to
that
you
and
to
your
new
law
as
you
call
it

My
duty
most
humbly
remembered
unto
your
Majesty’s

It
may
please
the
same
to
be
advertised
that
I
have
by
my
servants
received
your
most
honourable
letter
the
contents
whereof
do
not
a
little
trouble
me
and
so
much
the
more
for
that
any
of
my
servants
should
move
or
attempt
me
in
matters
touching
my
soul
which
I
think
the
meanest
subject
within
your
realm
could
evil
bear
at
their
servants’
hand
having
for
my
part
utterly
refused
heretofore
to
talk
with
them
in
such
matters
and
of
all
other
persons
least
regarded
them
therein
to
whom
I
have
declared
what
I
think
as
she
which
trusted
that
your
Majesty
would
have
suffered
me
your
poor
humble
sister
and
beadswoman
to
have
used
the
accustomed
Mass
which
the
King
your
father
and
mine
with
all
his
predecessors
evermore
used
wherein
also
I
have
been
brought
up
from
my
youth
and
thereunto
my
conscience
doth
not
only
bind
me
which
by
no
means
will
suffer
me
to
think
one
thing
and
do
another
but
also
the
promise
made
to
the
Emperor
by
your
Majesty’s
Council
was
an
assurance
to
me
that
in
so
doing
I
should
not
offend
the
laws
although
they
seem
now
to
qualify
and
deny
the
thing

And
at
my
last
waiting
upon
your
Majesty
I
was
so
bold
to
declare
my
mind
and
conscience
to
the
same
and
desired
your
Highness
rather
than
you
should
constrain
me
to
leave
the
mass
to
take
my
life
whereunto
your
Majesty
made
me
a
very
gentle
answer

And
therefore
I
take
it
that
the
matter
in
your
letter
proceeds
from
such
as
do
wish
those
things
to
take
place
which
be
most
agreeable
to
themselves
by
whose
doings
(
your
Majesty
not
offended
I
intend
not
to
rule
my
conscience

And
thus
without
molesting
your
Highness
any
further
I
humbly
beseech
the
same
ever
for
Gods
sake
to
bear
with
me
as
you
have
done
and
not
to
think
that
by
my
doings
or
example
any
inconvenience
might
grow
to
your
Majesty
or
your
realm
for
I
use
it
not
after
any
such
surety
putting
no
doubt
but
in
time
to
come
whether
I
live
or
die
your
Majesty
shall
perceive
mine
intent
is
grounded
upon
a
true
love
towards
you
whose
royal
estate
I
beseech
Almighty
God
long
to
continue
which
is
and
shall be
my
daily
prayer
according
to
my
duty

And
after
pardon
craved
of
your
Majesty
for
these
rude
and
bold
letters
if
neither
at
my
humble
suit
nor
for
regard
of
the
promise
made
to
the
Emperor
your
Highness
will
suffer
and
bear
with
me
as
you
have
done
till
your
Majesty
may
be
a
judge
herein
yourself
and
right
understand
their
proceedings
(
of
which
your
goodness
yet
I
despair
not
otherwise
rather
than
to
offend
God
and
my
conscience
I
offer
my
body
at
your
will
and
death
shall
be
more
welcome
than
life
with
a
troubled
conscience
Most
humbly
beseeching
your
Majesty
to
pardon
my
slowness
in
answering
your
letters
for
my
old
disease
would
not
suffer
me
to
write
any
sooner

And
thus
I
pray
Almighty
God
to
keep
your
Majesty
in
all
virtue
and
honour
with
good
health
and
long
life
to
his
pleasure

From
my
poor
house
at
Copped
Hall
the
xix
of
August

Your
Majesty’s
most
humble
sister
MARY

To
her
worshipful
sister
Mistress
Plompton
at
Plompton
Hall
delivers
these

Right
worshipful
sister
after
most
hearty
and
loving
recommendations
with
like
desire
of
your
good
health
and
the
long
continuance
of
the
same
this
shall
be
to
give
you
most
hearty
thanks
for
all
your
gentleness
unto
me
showed
and
in
especially
for
your
goodness
showed
unto
John
Pool
my
son
he
has
you
most
heartily
recommended
as
your
poor
kinsman
and
beadsman
and
he
desires
you
and
I
both
to
take
no
displeasure
with
him
for
his
long
tarying
here
for
as
yet
he
is
at
no
point
for
his
child’s
part
of
my
husband’s
goods

Also
my
son
Richard
and
John
recommend
them
to
you
and
their
aunt
Clare
and
to
Master
Dennis
and
to
all
other
their
good
friends

And
so
Jesus
preserves
you

From
Rodburn
the

By
your
sister

her
power
Ann
Poole

JANE
THE
QUEEN

By
the
Queen

Trusty
and
well beloved
we
greet
you
well

Albeit
that
our
estate
in
this
imperial
crown
whereof
we
be
actually
and
really
possessed
as
partly
may
appear
by
our
proclamation
wherein
our
title
is
published
is
not
nor
can
be
in
any
wise
doubtful
to
all
such
our
good
faithful
subjects
as
setting
blind
affection
apart
do
with
reason
and
wisdom
consider
the
very
foundation
and
ground
of
our
title
with
the
great
commodities
thereby
coming
through
God’s
providence
to
the
preservation
of
our
common
weal
and
policy
yet
for
that
we
understand
the
Lady
Mary
does
not
cease
by
letters
in
her
name
provoked
thereto
by
her
adherents
enemies
of
this
realm
to
publish
and
notify
scandalously
to
diverse
of
our
subjects’
matter
derogatory
to
our
title
and
dignity
royal
with
the
slander
of
certain
of
our
nobility
and
council
We
have
thought
meet
to
admonish
and
exhort
you
as
our
true
and
faithful
subjects
to
remain
fast
in
your
obeisance
and
duty
to
the
imperial
crown
of
this
realm
whereof
we
have
justly
the
possession
and
not
to
be
removed
any
wise
from
your
duty
by
sclandalous
reports
or
letters
dispersed
abroad
either
by
the
said
Lady
Mary
or
by
her
adherence
for
truly
like
as
the
nobility
of
our
realm
our
council
our
prelates
our
judges
and
learned
men
and
others
good
wise
men
godly
and
natural
subjects
do
remain
fast
and
surely
in
their
allegiance
towards
us
ready
to
adventure
their
lives
lands
and
goods
for
our
defense
so
can
a
great
number
of
the
same
nobility
counsellors
and
judges
truly
testify
to
all
the
world
with
safety
of
their
conscience
how
carefully
and
earnestly
the
late
King
of
famous
memory
our
dear
cousin
King
Edward
the
Sixth
from
time
to
time
mentioned
and
provoked
them
partly
by
persuasion
partly
commandments
to
have
such
respect
to
his
succession
if
God
should
call
him
to
his
mercy
without
issue
as
might
be
the
preservation
of
the
Crown
in
the
whole
undefiled
English
blood
and
therefore
of
his
own
mere
motion
both
by
grant
of
his
letters
patents
and
by
declaration
of
his
will
established
the
succession
as
it
is
declared
by
our
proclamation

Given
under
our
Signet
at
our
Tower
of
London
the
16th
day
of
July
in
the
first
year
of
our
reign

To
our
trusty
and
wellbeloved
the
Sheriff
justices
of
peace
and
other
gentlemen
of
our
county
of
Surrey
and
to
every
of
them

My
Lord
I
have
a
request
to
make
unto
your
Grace
which
fear
has
made
me
omit
till
this
time
for
two
causes
the
one
because
I
saw
that
my
request
for
the
rumours
which
were
spread
abroad
of
me
took
so
little
place
which
thing
when
I
considered
I
thought
I
should
little
profit
in
any
other
suit
albeit
now
I
understand
that
there
is
a
proclamation
for
them
(
for
the
which
I
give
your
Grace
and
the
rest
of
the
council
most
humble
thanks
I
am
the
bolder
to
speak
for
another
thing
and
the
other
was
because
peradventure
your
Lordship
and
the
rest
of
the
council
will
think
that
I
favour
her
evel
doing
for
whom
I
shall
speak
for
which
is
for
Kateryn
Aschiley
that
it
would
please
your
grace
and
the
rest
of
the
council
to
be
good
unto
her

Which
thing
I
do
not
to
favour
her
in
any
evel
(
for
that
I
would
be
sorry
to
do
but
for
these
considerations
which
follow
the
which
hope
does
teach
me
in
saying
that
I
ought
not
to
doubt
but
that
your
Grace
and
the
rest
of
the
council
will
think
that
I
do
it
for
the
other
considerations

First
because
that
she
has
been
with
me
a
long
time
and
many
years
and
has
taken
great
labor
and
pain
in
bringing
of
me
up
in
learning
and
honesty
and
therefore
I
ought
of
very
duty
speak
for
her
for
Saint
Gregory
says
that
we
are
more
bound
to
them
that
bring
us
up
well
than
to
our
parents
for
our
parents
do
that
which
is
natural
for
them
that
is
bring
us
into
this
World
but
our
bringers
up
are
a
cause
to
make
us
live
well
in
it

The
second
is
because
I
think
that
whatsoever
she
has
done
in
my
Lord
Admiral’s
matter
as
concerning
the
marrying
of
me
she
did
it
because
knowing
him
to
be
one
of
the
council
she
thought
he
would
not
go
about
any
such
thing
without
he
had
the
council’s
consent
thereunto
for
I
have
heard
her
many
times
say
that
she
would
never
have
me
marry
in
any
place
without
your
Grace’s
and
the
council’s
consent

The
third
cause
is
because
that
it
shall
and
doth
make
men
think
that
I
am
not
clear
of
the
deed
myself
but
that
it
is
pardoned
in
me
because
of
my
youth
because
that
she
I
loved
so
well
is
in
such
a
place

Thus
hope
prevailing
more
with
me
than
fear
hath
won
the
battle
and
I
have
at
this
time
gone
further
with
it

From
Hatfield
this
7
day
of
March

Also
if
I
may
be
so
bold
not
offending
I
beseech
your
Grace
and
the
rest
of
the
council
to
be
good
to
master
Aschiley
her
husband
which
because
he
is
my
kinsman
I
would
be
glad
he
should
do
well

Your
assured
friend
to
my
little
power
ELIZABETH

To
my
very
good
Lord
my
Lord
Protector

Right
trusty
and
welbeloved
Cousin
we
greet
you
heartly
well

Where
as
we
have
understand
by
report
of
our
familiar
servitor
Robert
Malvile
the
good
offers
made
to
our
behalf
by
the
Queen
our
good
sister
your
Sovereign
we
think
ourself
obliged
to
do
to
her
whatsoever
a
good
sister
and
tender
cousin
ought
where
she
finds
so
great
thankfulness
and
that
we
could
not
declare
the
affection
we
bear
towards
our
said
dearest
sister
better
nor
by
that
which
we
did
when
we
looked
not
to
have
brooked
this
life
12th
hours
in
our
laid
sickness
at
which
time
our
meaning
was
that
the
special
care
of
the
protection
of
our
son
should
rest
upon
our
said
good
sister

We
believe
ye
have
always
been
good
ministers
to
move
your
Sovereign
to
show
her
own
reasonable
favour
to
our
advancement
in
that
which
is
rich
and
firmly
likes
ye
will
so
continue

We
take
our
self
(
as
we
doubt
not
but
ye
know
to
be
the
Queen
your
Sovereign’s
next
cousin
and
next
herself
and
the
lawful
issue
of
her
body
to
have
greatest
interest
of
all
other
to
that
which
has
been
as
is
reported
lately
motioned
in
the
Parliament
House

As
to
us
we
will
no
wise
insist
therein
unto
such
time
as
it
shall
please
her
self
to
give
us
warning

We
desire
you
in
the
mean
time
to
have
that
opinion
of
us
that
as
we
mean
to
continue
all
our
life
in
good
intelligence
with
the
Queen
your
Sovereign
and
that
Realm
so
if
any
prince
in
earth
would
offend
the
same
we
would
withstand
him
at
our
utter
power
and
that
ye
can
not
advise
our
said
dearest
sister
to
extend
her
favour
towards
any
that
shall
recognize
it
in
a
better
sort

And
so
we
commit
you
to
the
protection
of
God

At
Dunbar
the
18
day
of
November
1566

Your
good
Cousin
MARIE
R.
To
the
Lords
of
the
Queen’s
Council

MADAM
Although
we
hear
that
since
the
death
of
your
husband
our
late
Ambassador
Sir
Thomas
Hoby
you
have
received
in
France
great
and
comfortable
courtesies
from
the
French
King
the
Queen
Mother
the
Queen
of
Navarre
and
sundry
others
yet
we
made
account
that
all
these
laid
together
cannot
so
satisfy
you
as
some
testimony
and
spark
of
our
favour
with
the
application
of
the
late
service
of
your
husband
and
of
your
own
demeanour
there
wherefore
though
you
shall
receive
it
somewhat
lately
in
time
yet
we
assure
you
the
same
proceeds
only
of
the
late
knowledge
of
your
return

And
therefore
we
let
you
know
that
the
service
of
your
husband
was
to
us
so
acceptable
as
next
yourself
and
your
children
we
have
not
the
meanest
loss
of
so
able
a
servant
in
that
calling

And
yet
since
it
has
so
pleased
God
to
call
him
in
the
entry
of
this
our
service
we
take
it
in
the
better
part
seeing
it
has
appeared
to
be
God’s
pleasure
to
call
him
away
so
favourably
to
the
service
of
him
especially
in
the
constancy
of
his
duty
towards
God
wherein
we
hear
say
he
died
very
commendably

And
so
we
would
have
you
to
rest
yourself
in
quietness
with
a
firm
opinion
of
our
especial
favour
towards
you

Given
under
our
Signet
at
our
City
of
Oxford
the
Of
September
1566
the
eight
year
of
our
Reign

Your
loving
Friend
ELIZABETH
R.
MADAME
Although
the
necessity
of
my
cause
(
which
makes
me
to
be
importune
to
you
do
make
you
to
judge
that
I
am
out
of
the
way
yet
such
as
have
not
my
passion
nor
the
respects
whereof
you
are
persuaded
will
think
that
I
do
as
my
cause
doth
require

Madame
I
have
not
accused
you
neither
in
words
nor
in
thought
to
have
used
yourself
evil
towards
me
and
I
believe
that
you
have
no
want
of
good
understanding
to
keep
you
from
persuasion
against
your
natural
good
inclination

But
in
the
mean
time
I
cannot
choose
(
having
my
senses
but
perceive
very
evil
furtherance
in
my
matters
since
my
coming
hither

I
thought
that
I
had
sufficiently
discoursed
unto
you
the
discommodities
which
this
delay
brought
unto
me

And
specially
that
they
think
in
this
next
month
of
August
to
hold
a
Parliament
against
me
and
all
my
servants

And
in
the
mean
time
I
am
stayed
here
and
yet
will
you
that
I
should
put
my
self
further
into
your
country
(
without
seeing
you
and
remove
me
further
from
mine
and
there
to
do
me
this
dishonour
at
the
requests
of
my
rebels
as
to
send
commissioners
to
hear
them
against
me
as
you
would
do
to
a
mean
subject
and
not
hear
me
by
mouth

But
being
not
so
I
cannot
accept
this
dishonour
at
their
hands
that
being
in
possession
they
will
come
and
accuse
me
before
your
commissioners
whereof
I
cannot
like

And
seeing
you
think
it
to
be
against
your
honour
and
cousinage
to
do
otherwise
I
beseech
you
that
you
will
not
be
mine
enemy
until
you
may
see
how
I
can
discharge
my
self
every
way

And
to
suffer
me
to
go
into
France
where
I
have
a
dowry
to
maintain
me
or
at
the
least
to
go
into
Scotland
with
assurance
that
if
there
come
any
strangers
thither
I
will
bind
my
self
for
their
return
without
any
prejudice
to
you

Or
if
it
please
you
not
to
do
thus
I
protest
that
I
will
not
impute
it
to
falsehood
if
I
receive
strangers
in
my
country
without
making
you
any
other
discharge
for
it

Do
with
my
body
at
your
will
the
honour
or
blame
shall be
yours

For
I
had
rather
die
here
and
that
my
faithful
servants
may
be
succoured
(
though
you
would
not
so
by
strangers
then
to
suffer
them
to
be
utterly
undone
upon
h
To
receive
in
time
to
come
particular
commodity

There
be
many
things
that
move
me
to
fear
that
I
shall
have
to
do
in
this
country
with
other
than
with
you

But
forasmuch
as
nothing
has
followed
upon
my
last
moan
I
hold
my
peace

This
has
been
refused
me
by
my
Lord
Scrooge
and
Mister
Knolls
(
as
they
say
by
your
commandment
because
I
would
not
depart
hence
to
your
charge
until
I
had
answer
of
this
letter
though
I
showed
them
that
you
required
my
answer
upon
the
two
points
contained
in
your
letter

The one
is
(
to
let
you
briefly
understand
them
I
am
come
to
you
to
make
my
moan
to
you
the
which
being
heard
I
would
declare
unto
you
mine
innocence
and
then
require
your
aide

And
for
lack
thereof
I
cannot
but
make
my
moan
and
complaint
to
God
that
I
am
not
heard
in
my
just
quarrel
and
to
appeal
to
other
princes
to
have
respect
thereunto
as
my
case
required
and
to
you
Madame
first
of
all
when
you
shall
have
examined
your
conscience
before
and
have
him
for
witness
and
the other
which
is
to
come
further
into
your
country
and
not
to
come
to
your
presence
I
will
esteem
that
as
no
favour
but
will
take
it
for
the
contrary
obeying
it
as
a
thing
forced

In
the
mean
time
I
beseech
you
to
return
to
me
my
Lord
Heris
for
I
cannot
be
without
him
having
none
of
my
council
here
and
also
to
suffer
me
if
it
please
you
without
further
delay
to
depart
hence
whither
so
ever
it
is
out
of
this
country

I
am
sure
you
will
not
deny
me
this
simple
request
for
your
honour's
sake
seeing
it
does
not
please
you
to
use
your
natural
goodness
towards
me
other ways

And
seeing
that
of
mine
accord
I
am
come
hither
let
me
depart
again
with
yours

And
if
God
permit
my
causes
to
succeed
well
I
shall be
bound
to
you
for
it
and
happening
otherwise
yet
I
cannot
blame
you

As
for
my
lord
Flemin
seeing
that
upon
my
credit
you
have
suffered
him
to
go
home
to
his
house
I
warrant
you
he
shall
pass
no
further
but
shall
return
when
it
shall
please
you

For
I
have
left
them
in
charge
to
have
more
respect
to
my
servants
and
to
mine
estate
then
to
my
life
Good
sister
be
of
an
other
mind

Win
the
heart
and
all
shall be
yours
and
at
your
commandment

I
thought
to
satisfy
you
wholly
if
I
might
have
seen
you

Alas
do
not
as
the
serpent
that
stopped
his
hearing
for
I
am
no
enchanter
but
your
sister
and
natural
cousin

If
Cesar
had
not
disdained
to
hear
or
read
the
complaint
of
an
advertiser
he
had
not
so
died

Why
should
Prince's
ears
be
stopped
seeing
they
are
painted
so
long
meaning
that
they
should
hear
all
and
be
well
advised
before
they
answer

I
am
not
of
the
nature
of
the
basilisk
and
less
of
the
camelions
to
turn
you
to
my
likeness
and
though
I
should
be
so
dangerous
and
cursed
as
men
say
you
are
sufficiently
armed
with
constance
and
with
justice
which
I
require
of
God
who
give
you
grace
to
use
it
well
with
long
and
happy
life

From
Carlisle
this
5th
of
July
1568

I
will
send
you
little
token
to
remember
you
of
the
good
hope
I
have
in
you
if
ye
find
a
meet
messenger
I
would
wish
ye
bestowed
it
rather
upon
her
non
any
other
thus
after
my
recommendations
I
pray
God
have
you
in
his
keeping

Your
assured
good
friend
MARIE
R.
Excuse
my
evil
writing
this
first
time

Right
honourable
I
am
forced
for
better
expedition
to
use
an
unaccustomed
manner
of
writing
unto
you
the
cause
proceeding
from
a
report
of
sum
whom
neither
can
I
judge
friendly
to
my
self
nor
yet
indifferent
towards
him
from
whom
they
seek
by
malice
to
prevent
and
detain
his
worthy
preferment
sued
for
and
obtained
by
his
honourable
benefactors
I
means
my
singular
good
Lord
my
Lord
of
Lecestre
and
especially
your
self
by
whose
favour
(
attained
by
the
request
of
my
friends
and
his
desert
towards
me
assisted
by
the
worthiness
of
his
life
and
learning
Mr
Thorneton
my
reader
has
unto
him
granted
the
next
preferment
of
a
cannonry
in
this
college
of
Christchurch

And
since
it
has
pleased
God
(
as
I
gave
you
humbly
to
understand
in
my
last
letters
to
call
unto
his
mercy
one
Thomas
Daie
by
means
whereof
it
rests
in
your
honourable
favour
to
present
(
according
to
your
former
pretence
him
as well
for
whose
cause
as
divers
others
I
do
account
my
self
no
less
bound
then
I
ought

For
that
it
is
very
constantly
reported
that
Mr
Tobie
Matthews
friends
should
use
in
his
behalf
some
earnest
suit
unworthy
their
callings
(
because
it
was
moved
before
the
death
of
the
incumbent
by
the
which
it
should
seem
they
sought
rather
by
spite
to
prevent
the
one
then
honestly
to
prefer
the
other
these
are
therefore
most
humbly
to
request
such
your
wonted
favour
as
neither
your
honourable
benefit
may
be
revoked
my
humble
and
earnest
suit
prevented
neither
the
person
him
self
so
discredited
but
that
he
may
with
your
favour
enjoy
his
advowson
by
your
means
obtained
and
your
self
promised

Thus
humbly
commanding
my
duty
unto
your
good
opinion
my
self
priest
at
your
commandment
I
humbly
end

From
Oxford
this
26
of
February
Anno
156970
Yours
in
as
humble
sort
as
your
own
Philip
Sidney

To
the
right
honourable
Sir
William
Cecil
Knight
her
Majesty’s
principal
Secretary
etc.

And
they
shall
not
seem
to
you
to
confess
plainly
their
knowledge
than
we
warrant
you
to
cause
them
both
or
either
of
them
to
be
brought
to
the
rack
and
first
to
move
them
with
fear
thereof
to
deal
plainly
in
their
answers
and
if
that
shall
not
move
them
then
you
shall
cause
them
to
be
put
to
the
rack
and
to
find
the
taste
thereof
until
they
shall
deal
more
plainly
or
until
you
shall
think
meet

And
so
we
remit
the
whole
proceeding
to
your
further
discretion
requiring
you
to
use
speed
herein
and
to
require
the
assistance
of
our
Lieutenant
of
the
Tour

Given
under
our
signet
the
15th
of
September
1571

To
our
trusty
and
right
well
beloved
Counsellors
Sir
Thomas
yth
Knight
and
to
our
tie
and
welbeloved
Doctor
son
one
of
the
Masters
of
our
Requests

Received
at
the
Tower
the
16
day
of
September
at
eleven
of
the
clock
in
the
forenoon
1571

My
Lord
me
thinks
that
I
am
more
beholding
to
the
hinder
part
of
my
bed
than
well
dare
trust
the
forwards
side
of
the
same
and
therefore
sent
to
the
Lieutenant
and
the
S.
as
you
know
best
the
Order
to
defer
this
execution
till
they
hear
further

And
that
this
may
be
done
I
doubt
nothing
without
curiosities
of
my
further
warrant
for
that
their
rash
determination
upon
a
very
unfit
day
was
countermanded
by
your
considerate
admonition

The
causes
that
move
me
to
this
are
not
now
to
be
expressed
lest
an
irrevocable
deed
is
in
mean
while
committed

Right

Lord
and
uncle
this
bearer
having
showed
me
the
works

to
send
these
few
words
unto
your
Lordship
though
my
writing
at
this
present
unto
you
by
an
English
gentleman
that
does
now
return
take
away
any
other
cause
of
enlarging
the
same

This
bearer
has
promised
me
to
let
no
man
see
that
which
he
carries
until
he
have
showed
them
unto
your
Lordship

If
they
may
seem
unto
your
Lordship
unworthy
of
which
I
should
write
unto
you
I
do
most
humbly
beseech
you
to
condemn
therein
nothing
but
my
ignorance
which
bending
it
self
wholly
to
content
you
if
it
do
err
I
hope
your
goodness
will
suffer
the
dutiful
mind
to
recompense
the
want
of
judgement
which
being
all
that
I
have
at
this
time
to
trouble
you
withal
I
will
most
lowly
commit
you
to
the
eternal
protection

From
Frankfurt
this
18th
of
March
Anno
1572-3
Your
most
humble
and
most
obedient
nephew
Philip
Sidney

Wherefore
I
have
most
humbly
to
beseech
your
Lordship
that
if
in
any
of
my
proceedings
I
have
erred
you
will
vouchsafe
to
impute
that
to
the
not
knowing
your
Lordships
and
their
pleasure
by
whose
commandment
I
am
likewise
to
be
directed

I
was
upon
Thursday
last
with
Count
Lodovik
the
prince
of
Oronge’s
second
brother
whose
honourable
usage
was
such
towards
me
and
such
goodwill
he
seems
to
bear
unto
your
Lordship
that
for
want
of
further
ability
I
can
but
wish
him
a
prosperous
success
to
such
noble
enterprises
as
I
doubt
not
he
will
shortly
(
with
the
help
of
God
put
in
execution

I
found
one
Shambourg
an
Allmaine
with
him
a
gentleman
whom
I
knew
in
the
court
of
France
always
very
affectionate
to
the
King’s
service
I
doubt
not
but
that
he
essays
to
draw
the
Count
to
serve
the
King
but
I
hope
he
labours
in
vain

All
men’s
eyes
are
so
bent
to
the
affairs
of
France
and
Flanders
that
there
is
no
talk
here
of
any
other
country

I
have
an
humble
request
unto
your
Lordship
which
is
that
it
will
please
you
to
thank
master
Culverwell
the
bearer
hereof
for
the
courtesy
he
showed
unto
me
in
employing
his
credit
for
me
being
driven
into
some
necessity

Thus
craving
pardon
for
the
continuance
of
my
wonted
manner
in
vainly
troubling
your
Lordship
I
will
most
lowly
leave
you
in
his
guard
who
ever
preserve
you

From
Frankfort
this
23th
of
March
1572-3
Your
most
humble
and
most
obedient
nephew
Philip
Sidney

To
the
right
honourable
and
my
singular
good
Lord
and
uncle
the
Earl
of
Leicester
etc.

Wherefore
I
humbly
beseech
your
Lordship
to
take
these
few
lines
in
good
part
which
I
write
rather
to
continue
this

I
owe
unto
you
then
for
any
other
thing
they
may
continue
in
them

The
Emperor
as
I
wrote
last
unto
your
Lordship
has
these
two
years
continually
pretended
a
journey
to
Prague
which
it
is
thought
shall
indeed
be
performed
to
the
great
contentacion
of
that
kingdom
which
otherwise
seemed
to
bend
to
disobedience

There
it
is
thought
his
son
shall
very
shortly
be
king
whom
likewise
the
Emperor
seeks
by
all
means
possible
to
advance
to
the
Kingdom
of
the
Romaines
and
for
that
purpose
desires
to
call
an
imperial
diet
in
Frankfort
the
appointed
for
the
elections
but
it
is
thought
the
electors
will
rather
choose
an
other
for
this
next
ensuing
diet
which
is
said
shall
be
summer
following
at
the
furthest
and
then
there
is
no
hope
of
election

Not
being
at
Frankfort
it
is
likely
it
shall
at
Regensburg
where
I
believe
the
Emperor
will
demand
far
greater
sums
of
money
than
will
be
granted
unto
him

Though
the
peace
betwixt
the
Turk
and
him
as
yet
as
far
as
it
is
known
perfectly
concluded
yet
it
is
thought
the
Turk
will
rather
proceed
by
sea
then
this
way
and
as
the
French
ambassador
has
written
means
to
visit
the
Pope’s
territory
perchance
his
conscience
moves
him
to
seek
the
benefit
of
Jubile

I
hope
as
the
Spaniards
already
begin
to
speak
lower
so
the
Pope’s
holiness
will
have
less
leisure
to
minister
such
wicked
and
detestable
councils
to
the
Christian
princes
as
hitherto
he
does

Out
of
France
your
Lordship
has
the
advertisements
for
the
Prince
of
Conde
is
retired
to
Basill
where
he
lives
in
company
with
the
Admiral’s
children
being
frustrate
of
a
great
hope
he
had
conceived
of
suckory
out
of
Germany
wherein
many
and
wise
men
do
impute
great
fault
to
the
Prince
Casimire
the
Count
Palatine’s
second
son
in
so
much
that
to
write
to
your
Lordship
plainly
he
is
heavily
suspected
to
be
corrupted
by
the
French

The
Polaks
heartily
repent
their
so
farfetched
election
being
now
in
such
case
neither
they
have
the
King
nor
any
thing
the
King
with
so
many
oaths
had
promised
besides
that
there
is
lately
stirred
up
a
very
dangerous
sedition
for
the
same
cause
that
has
bred
such
lamentable
ruins
in
France
and
Flanders

Now
the
is
reasonably
well
appeased
but
it
is
thought
it
will
remain
so
but
a
while

I
have
no
other
thing
worthy
the
writing
at
this
present
to
your
Lordship
wherefore
I
humbly
cease
with
my
daily
and
most
bound
prayer
that
it
please
the
Eternal
to
continue
and
increase
you
in
all
prosperity

From
Vienna

This
27

of
November

1574

Your
Lordship’s
most
Philip
Sidney

Since
the
last
I
write
unto
your
Lordship
I
have
not
had
any
convenient
means
of
sending
my
scribbles
which
humble
office
I
desire
to
continue
rather
to
obey
therein
your
commandment
than
for
anything
worthy
to
be
advertised
they
may
happen
to
continue
in
them

Now
having
opportunity
by
a
friend
of
mine
who
presently
sends
his
letters
into
England
I
would
not
omit
this
occasion
beseeching
your
Lordship
rather
to
respect
the
hearty
desire
to
please
you
than
the
simplicity
of
the
contents
better
than
which
your
Lordship
ought
not
to
expect
of
me

Being
returned
out
of
Italy
and
detained
for
some
time
with
sickness
in
this
city
yet
could
I
not
command
my
desire
of
seeing
Poland
which
time
notwithstanding
I
might
perchance
have
employed
in
more
profitable
at
least
more
pleasant
voyages
from
thence
being
of
late
come
hither
not
in
very
good
estate
of
body
I
find
the
affairs
of
this
court
as
far
as
I
can
learn
to
pass
in
order

The
Emperor
has
at
length
obtained
his
long
desired
truce
of
the
great
Turk
for
8
years
the
grant
of
which
he
has
understood
by
a
courier
sent
by
his
leger
ambassador
called
Charles
Rym
who
is
now
in
his
returnee
not
far
hence
and
in
his
room
there
is
already
at
Constantinople
David
Ungnad

The
conditions
of
the
peace
are
not
as
yet
known
but
the
Emperor
is
resolute
to
refuse
no
burden
rather
than
enter
in
war

He
does
expect
very
shortly
the
Turkish
ambassador
for
the
confirmation
of
the
peace
who
is
by
nation
a
Dutch
man
born
in
Bavier
the
Turks
principal
interpreter
named
among
them
Mehemet
Beck

This
courier
has
brought
news
from
Constantinople
that
the
Turks’
navy
is
safe
returned
which
he
will
increase
the
next
year
with
a
hundred
galleys
for
to
invade
Sicily

By
the
way
Petro
Portocarrero
Captain
of
the
Gollett
is
deceased

In
my
simple
opinion
they
have
been
provoked
by
the
Portuguese
to
take
this
matter
far
above
their
forces
upon
them
for
that
the
Turk
by
the
read
sea
does
greatly
encroach
upon
their
Indian
traffic

The
expectation
of
these
ambassadors
will
cause
the
Emperor
to
delay
his
journey
to
Bohemia
which
notwithstanding
he
must
necessarily
ere
it
be
long
perform
they
being
very
evil
content
of
his
so
long
absence
in
so
much
that
this
year
they
have
plainly
refused
to
give
certain
great
sums
of
money
which
heretofore
they
had
not
denied

Besides
that
he
must
please
them
for
to
get
his
son
the
crown
for
although
he
do
pretend
hereditary
succession
thetyseeme
they
will
not
grant
it
any
other
way
but
in
manner
of
election

In
this
means
time
he
has
sent
the
Lord
of
Rosemberg
a
principal
nobleman
of
Bohemia
to
the
electors
of
Sax
and
Brandenbourg
and
the
Lord
of
Arach
to
the
other
4
electors
of
the
Rhine
to
consult
of
an
Imperial
diet
which
it
is
not
unlikely
shall
be
this
summer
following
wherein
if
it
be
possible
he
will
persuade
the
election
of
his
son
to
the
kingdom
of
the
Romaines
as
the
term
it

The
Polakes
having
appeased
a
great
sedition
in
Crackow
for
the
religion
have
since
defeated
twelve
thousand
Tartars
among
which
there
were
3000
Turks
whose
returnee
with
far
greater
force
they
do
daily
look
for

It
is
thought
they
will
chose
an
other
King
in
May
although
the
Lithuanians
be
holy
against
It

They
have
made
truce
with
the
Moscovit
who
bends
his
forces
as
they
say
against
the
King
of
Sweden
for
having
burnt
a
town
of
his
called
Narva

Thus
your
Lordship
may
see
how
bold
I
am
upon
your
commandment
to
trouble
you
from
your
weighty
affairs
for
which
craving
pardon
and
good
acceptation
I
humbly
cease
beseeching
the
Eternal
to
grant
you
in
health
increase
of
all
honour

Philip
Sidney

To
the
right
honourable
and
my
singular
good
Lord
the
Lord
high
Treasurer

ELIZABETH
R.
By
the
Queen

Right
trusty
and
right
welbeloved
Cousin
and
Counselor
we
greet
you
well

Whereas
the
Queen
of
Scots
has
been
destitute
of
a
French
Secretary
since
the
death
of
Rollet
and
has
by
her
own
letters
and
by
means
out
of
France
desired
us
to
suffer
an
other
to
come
and
supply
that
place
about
her
which
we
have
hitherto
forborne
to
graunt
for
divers
good
causes
and
among
other
for
the
evil
offices
which
her
other
secretary
did
there
whereof
you
are
not
ignorant

Now
forasmuch
as
the
bearer
hereof
called
de
Naou
a
Frencheman
hath
been
chosen
and
recommended
to
us
by
our
brother
the
French
King
with
request
that
he
may
go
to
her
and
serve
her
as
her
secretary
and
has
promised
that
he
shall
carry
himself
in
that
even
manner
that
becomes
an
honest
minister
nor
shall
practice
any
hurtful
or
offensive
thing
which
he
himself
has
also
vowed
and
promised
here
with
offer
that
if
he
shall
at
any
time
be
found
fault
he
submitts
him
self
to
any
punishment
Upon
these
respects
and
at
her
earnest
request
we
are
pleased
that
the
said
de
Naou
shall
resort
thither
and
abide
with
her
as
her
secretary

And
so
our
pleasure
is
you
shall
receive
him
into
her
company
and
suffer
him
to
serve
her
in
that
place
admonishing
him
now
at
his
entry
and
also
hereafter
to
have
consideration
of
the
caution
which
our
said
brother
the
French
King
has
given
us
for
him
and
also
of
his
own
promise
as
he
will
avoid
the
danger
wherein
he
has
condemned
himself
if
he
shall be
here in
found
faulty

Given
under
our
Signet
at
our
Manor
of
Saint
James
the
29th
of
March
1575

To
the
Worshipful
his
very
singular
good
friend
Master
G
of
Trinity
Hall
in
Cambridge

Good
Master
G

I
perceive
by
your
most
courteous
and
friendly
Letters
your
good
will
to
be
no
less
in
deed
than
I
always
esteemed

In
recompense
whereof
think
I
beseech
you
that
I
will
spare
neither
speech
nor
writing
nor
aught
else
whenever
and
wheresoever
occasion
shall
be
offered
me
yea
I
will
not
stay
till
it
be
offered
but
will
seek
it
in
all
that
possibly
I
may

And
that
you
may
perceive
how
much
your
Counsel
in
all
things
prevail
with
me
and
how
altogether
I
am
ruled
and
over-ruled
thereby
I
am
now
determined
to
alter
mine
own
former
purpose
and
to
subscribe
to
your
advisement
being
notwithstanding
resolved
still
to
abide
your
farther
resolution

My
principal
doubts
are
these

First
I
was
minded
for
a
while
to
have
intermitted
the
uttering
of
my
writings
least
by
over-much
cloying
their
noble
ears
I
should
gather
a
contempt
of
my
self
or
else
seem
rather
for
gain
and
commodity
to
do
it
for
some
sweetness
that
I
have
already
tasted

Then
also
me
seems
the
work
too
base
for
his
excellent
Lordship
being
made
in
honour
of
a
private
personage
unknown
which
of
some
ill-willers
might
be
upbraided
not
to
be
so
worthy
as
you
know
she
is
or
the
matter
not
so
weighty
that
it
should
be
offered
to
so
weighty
a
personage
or
the
like

And
indeed
for
your
self
to
it
sits
with
you
now
to
call
your
wits
and
senses
together
(
which
are
always
at
call
when
occasion
is
so
fairly
offered
of
estimation
and
preferment

For
whiles
the
iron
is
hot
it
is
good
striking
and
minds
of
nobles
vary
as
their
estates

Verum
ne
Quid
durius

I
pray
you
bethink
you
well
hereof
good
Master
G

and
forthwith
write
me
those
two
or
three
special
points
and
caveats
for
the
nonce
De
quibus
in
superioribus
illis
mellitissimis
longissimisque
Litteris
tuis

Your
desire
to
hear
of
my
late
being
with
her
Majesty
must
dye
in
it
self

As
for
the
two
worthy
gentlemen
Master
Sidney
and
Master
Dyer
they
have
me
I
thank
them
in
some
use
of
familiarity
of
whom
and
to
whom
what
speech
passes
for
your
credit
and
estimation
I
leave
yourself
to
conceive
having
always
so
well
conceived
of
my
unfained
affection
and
zeal
towards
you

And
now
they
have
proclaimed
in
their
title
a
general
surceasing
and
silence
of
bald
rhymers
and
also
of
the
very
best
to
in
stead
whereof
they
have
by
authority
of
their
whole
Senate
prescribed
certain
laws
and
rules
of
quantities
of
English
syllables
for
English
verse
having
had
thereof
already
great
practise
and
drawn
me
to
their
faction

Such
might
I
happily
incur
entitling
My
Slomber
and
the
other
pamphlets
unto
his
honour

I
meant
them
rather
to
Master
Dyer

But
I
am
of
late
more
in
love
with
my
English
versifying
than
with
rhyming
which
I
should
have
done
long
since
if
I
would
then
have
followed
your
council

Master
E.K

heartily
desires
to
be
recommended
unto
your
worship
of
whom
what
account
he
makes
your
self
shall
hereafter
perceive
by
his
painful
and
dutiful
verses
of
your
self

Thus
much
was
written
at
Westminster
yesternight
but
coming
this
morning
being
the
sixteenth
of
October
to
Mistress
Kerkes
to
have
it
delivered
to
the
Carrier
I
received
your
letter
sent
me
the
last
week
whereby
I
perceive
you
otherwise
continue
your
old
exercise
of
versifying
in
English
which
glory
I
had
now
thought
should
have
been
only
ours
here
at
London
and
the
court

Trust
me
your
verses
I
like
passingly
well
and
envy
your
hidden
pains
in
this
kind
or
rather
malign
and
grudge
at
your
self
that
would
not
once
impart
so
much
to
me

And
now
requite
I
you
with
the
like
not
with
the
very
best
but
with
the
very
shortest
namely
with
a
few
iambics
I
dare
warrant
they
be
precisely
perfect
for
the
feet
(
as
you
can
easily
judge
and
vary
not
one
inch
from
the
rule

I
will
impart
yours
to
Master
Sidney
and
Master
Dyer
at
my
next
going
to
the
court

I
pray
you
keep
mine
close
to
your
self
or
your
very
entire
friends

Preston

Still

of
my
unhappy

make
thy
self
fluttering
wings
of
thy
fast
flying
Thought
and
fly
forth
unto
my
Love
wheresoever
she
be
whether
lying
restless
in
heavy
bed
or
else
sitting
so
cheerless
at
the
cheerful
board
or
else
playing
alone
careless
on
her
heavenly
virginals

If
in
bed
tell
her
that
my
eyes
can
take
no
rest
If
at
board
tell
her
that
my
mouth
can
eat
no
meat
If
at
her
virginals
tell
her
I
can
hear
no
mirth

Asked
why
say
waking
love
suffers
no
sleep

I

I

any
more
to
write
unto
you
before
I
go
and
withall
committing
to
your

the
eternal
memory
of
our
everlasting

the

of
our

which
I

you
continue
with
usual
writings
as
you
may
and
of
all
things
let
me
hear
some
news
from
you

As
gentle
M.

I
thank
his
good
worship
has
required
of
me

so
promised
to

again

may
always
send
them
most
safely
to
me
by
Mistress
Kerke
and
by
none
other

So
once
again

yet
once
more
Farewell

it
is
that
your

Mr.
Hugh
by
enjoying
his

now
by
the

I

my

Cambridge
this

November

Yours
(

To
my
long
approved
and
singular
good
friend
Master
G
Good
Master
H.
I
doubt
not
but
you
have
some
great
important
matter
in
hand
which
all
this
while
restrains
your
pain
and
wonted
readiness
in
provoking
me
unto
that
wherein
your
self
now
fault

If
there
be
any
such
thing
in
hatching
I
pray
you
heartily
let
us
know
before
all
the
world
see
it

But
if
happily
you
dwell
altogether
in
Iustinians
Court
and
give
your
self
to
be
devoured
of
secret
studies
as
of
all
likelihood
you
do
yet
at
least
impart
some
your
old
or
new
Latin
or
English
eloquent
and
gallant
poesies
to
us
from
whose
eyes
you
say
you
keep
in
a
manner
nothing
hidden

I
think
the
earthquake
was
also
there
with
you
(
which
I
would
gladly
learn
as
it
was
here
with
us
overthrowing
divers
old
buildings
and
pieces
of
churches

Sure
very
strange
to
be
heard
of
in
these
countries
and
yet
I
hear
some
say
(
I
know
not
how
truly
that
they
have
known
the
like
before
in
their
days

Sed
Quid
vobis
videtur
magnis
Philosophis
I
like
your
late
English
hexameters
so
exceedingly
well
that
I
also
endure
my
pain
sometime
in
that
kind
which
I
find
indeed
as
I
have
heard
you
often
defend
in
word
neither
so
hard
nor
so
harsh
that
it
will
easily
and
fairly
yield
it
self
to
our
mother
tongue

For
the
only
or
chiefest
hardness
which
seems
is
in
the
accent
which
sometime
gapes
and
as
it
were
yawns
illfavouredly
coming
short
of
that
it
should
and
sometime
exceeding
the
measure
of
the
number
as
in
Carpenter
the
middle
syllable
being
used
short
in
speech
when
it
shall
be
read
long
in
verse
seems
like
a
lame
Gosling
that
draws
one
leg
after
her
and
heaven
being
used
short
as
one
syllable
when
it
is
in
verse
stretched
out
with
a
diastole
is
like
a
lame
dog
that
holds
up
one
leg

But
it
is
to
be
one
with
custom
and
rough
words
must
be
subdued
with
use

For
why
a
God’s
name
may
not
we
as
else
the
Greeks
have
the
kingdom
of
our
own
language
and
measure
our
accents
by
the
sound
reserving
the
quantity
to
the
verse
Lo
here
I
let
you
see
my
old
use
of
toying
in
rhymes
turned
Into
your
artificial
straightness
of
verse
by
this
Tetrasticon

I
beseech
you
tell
me
your
fancy
without
partiality

See
you
the
blindfolded
pretty
God
that
feathered
archer
Of
lovers’
miseries
which
make
his
bloody
game

Seem
they
comparable
to
those
two
which
I
translated
you
ex
tempore
In
bed
the
last
time
we
lay
together
in
Westminster

That
which
I
eat
did
I
joy
and
that
which
I
greedily
gorged
As
for
those
many
goodly
matters
left
I
for
others

I
would
heartily
wish
you
would
either
send
me
the
Rules
and
Precepts
of
Art
which
you
observe
in
quantities
or
else
follow
mine
that
M.
Philip
Sidney
gave
me
being
the
very
same
which
M.
Drant
devised
but
enlarged
with
M.
Sidneys
own
judgement
and
augmented
with
my
observations
that
we
might
both
accord
and
agree
in
one
least
we
overthrow
one
an
other
and
be
overthrown
of
the
rest

Trust
me
you
will
hardly
believe
what
great
good
liking
and
estimation
Master
Dyer
had
of
your
satirical
verses
and
I
since
the
view
thereof
having
before
of
my
self
had
special
liking
of
English
versifying
am
even
now
about
to
give
you
some
token
what
and
owe
well
therein
I
am
able
to
do
for
to
tell
you
truth
I
mind
shortly
at
convenient
leisure
to
set
forth
a
book
in
this
kind
which
I
entitle
Epithalamion
Thamesis
which
book
I
dare
undertake
will
be
very
profitable
for
the
knowledge
and
rare
for
the
invention
and
manner
of
handling

For
in
setting
forth
the
marriage
of
the
Thames
I
show
his
first
beginning
and
offspring
and
all
the
country
that
he
passes
thorough
and
also
describe
all

Mr.
Broughton
I
understand
by
this
bearer
Richard
Powell
my
father's
old
servant
that
he
holds
a
little
tenement
of
me
in
Lynols
of
7
shillings
4
pence
rent
and
there
is
there
a
farm
called
Sherrat's
Farm
which
the
widow
that
holds
it
is
not
desirous
to
sue
for

I
pray
you
let
him
obtain
so
much
favour
that
he
may
take
it
for
his
money
before
any
other
which
is
his
only
suit

William
Powell
has
been
here
with
me
craving
some
help
or
relief
at
my
hands
for
whom
I
would
do
for
his
Master's

sake
anything
that
I
could
and
therefore
considering
his
want
I
desire
you
if
you
can
spie
any
such
things
whereby
he
might
have
some
stay
of
living
that
you
will
provide
for
him

Thus
with
26
dozen
of

my

I
bid
you

me

I
specially
commend

Mr.

I
received
letters
from
my
Aunt
Devereux
touching
the
death
of
one
Browne
late
parson
of
Baxterley
in
the
which
she
referred
the
presentation
of
the
next
incumbent
to

I
do
think
the
order
which
is
to
be
taken
in
that
behalf
to
require
your
advice
that
thereby
no

be
taken
against

I
am
desirous
to
bestow
the
things
on
Mr.

therefore
do
desire
you
to
further
my
good
meaning
towards
him
that
he
may
enjoy
the
same
if
by
your
counsel
my
presentation
be
sufficient
and
lawful
then
will
I
upon
advertisement
given
send
him
one
from
York
if
otherwise
I
look
to
be
advised
by
you
what
course
is
most
convenient

Master
Wright
that
he
has
received
nothing
of

Annuity

my
coming

do
assure

it

not

against

may

1
o'
clock
received
your
letter

does
signify
that
her
Majesty’s
pleasure
is
I
should
stay
my
preparations
until
I
do
speak
with

I
will
let
you
know
how
far
I
have
gone
and
then
I
shall
obey
her
Majesty’s

being
known
from
you
for
stay
of
the
rest
and
to
undo
of
that
is
done
as
her
will
shall be

upon
her
first
order
given
both
from
her
self
and
also
confirmed
further
by
your
letters
by
her
Majesty’s
commandment
I
dispatched
between
Thursday
night
and
yesternight
4
o'clock
above
200
letters
to
my
servants
and
sundry
my
friends
to
prepare
themselves
according
to
the
order
I
had
my
self
with
all
the
speed
that
could
possible
to
serve
her
Majesty
under
me
in
the
Low
Countries

I
have
set
in
hand
sundry
furniture
also
for
my
self

I
have
taken
up
2
or
3
vessels
to
carry
away
presently
certain
provisions
as
bear
and
other
necessaries
which
must
be
their
before
me

And
lastly
that
I
am
most
sorry
for
the
states
that
were
at
court
came
hither
to
me
this
morning
by
9
o'clock
and
spent
2
hours
with
me
touching
my
dispatch
in
so
much
as
they
were
ready
to
kneel
to
me
for
to
make
what
has
for
my
none
arrival
on
the
other
side
that
I
could
possibly
you
by
all
persuasions
pressing
me
that
I
would
not
stay
tell
my
full
preparations
were
made
and
my
companies
but
to
be
known
once
to

at
Middlebrow
or
Flushing
with
such
as
may
soonest
be
ready
for
by
that
means
I
should
be
the
cause
of
stay
of
greater
matters
than
would
be
wished
throw
longer
delay
for
they
said
it
was
very
long
already

They
offered
me
with
all
that
many
things
should
be
their
made
ready
to
receive
me
even
so
soon
as
if
I
went
within
6
days
I
should
be
prepared
for

I
did
hereupon
tell
them
what
straight
commandment
I
had
received
from
her
majesty
to
hast
me
over
and
what
good
will
they
should
now
find
in
me
to
perform
the
same

We
agreed
that
I
should
send
some
servant
of
mine
to
have
their
letters
over
to
see
all
things
made
their
ready
for
me
if
I
should
follow
within
14
or
15
days
I
did
so
and
sent
D.
Doyly
whom
you
know
who
has
their
letters
and
except
my
messenger
find
him
he
is
gone
this
morning
tide
before
3
o'clock
yet
have
I
upon
the
sight
of
your
letter
sent
one
to
seek
him
and
to
stay
him

This
far
already
have
I
proceeded

I
told
the
states
also
that
I
stayed
hereabout

I
should

for
my

I
am
sorry
I
could
not
take
my
leave

before
my
departure
but
I
heard
which
I
am
sorry
for
that
your

pains
increased
after
my
going
from
the
court
and
did
let
your
intended
coming
to
London
but
seeing
that
opportunity
taken
away
I
have
thought
it
my
part
to
bid
your
Lordship
fare
well

these
few
lines
wherein
I
shall

My
good
Lord
I
may
not
having
this
occasion
be
unmindful
of
these
things
also
which
I
did
think
at
my
leave
taking
to
have
remembered
to
your
Lordship
albeit
I
know
the
care
you
always
have
of
her
Majesty’s
good
services

Your
Lordship
can
not
but
remember
the
cause
for
which
it
has
pleased
her
majesty
to
send
me
into
the
Low
Countries

It
was
not
only
by
your
Lordship
but
by
the
whole
number
of
councillors
agreed
upon
how
mete
and
necessary
it
was
for
her
Highness
to
yield
aid
and
assistance
for
the
relief
of
those
afflicted
countries
her
neighbours
and
most
ancient
friends
it
has
grown
since
to
nearer
terms
and
resolutions
as well
by
her
Majesty’s
own
words
of
comfort
to
them
as

contracts
set
down
between
her
and
them
by
her
Majesty’s
commissioners
appointed
for
the
purpose

Hit
cannot
be
but
whatsoever
lack
shall
happen
to
me
in
this
service
but
the
want
must
turn
to
her
Majesty
and
as
there
can
no
good
or
honour
fall
to
this
action
but
it
must
be
wholly
to
the
praise
and
honour
of
her
Majesty
so
whatsoever
disgrace
or
dishonour
shall
happen
(
growing
for
lack
of
our
good
maintenance
but
it
will
redound
to
her
Majesty
also

Her
Majesty
I
see
my
Lord
often
times
does
fall
into
mislike
of
this
cause
and
sundry
opinions
it
may
breed
in
her
with
all
but
I
trust
in
the
Lord
seeing
her
Highness
has
thus
far
resolved
and
grown
also
to
this
far
execution
as
she
has
and
that
mine
and
other
men’s
poor
lives
and
substances
are
adventured
for
her
sake
and
by
her
commandment
that
she
will
fortify
and
maintain
her
own
action
to
the
full
performance
of
that
she
has
agreed
on

Than
shall
there
be
no
doubt
but
assured
hope
of
all
good
success
to
the
glory
of
God
and
perpetual
honour
to
her
Majesty

My
good
Lord
you
may
conceive
my
meaning
without
more
words
used
to
you
and
the
rather
for
that
I
desired
Mr.
Secretary
to
impart
a
letter
to
you
I
wrote
to
him

I
beseech
your
Lordship
have
this
cause
even
to
your
heart
as
it
does
appear
you
have
done
by
consenting
to
the
adventure
of
your
eldest
son
in
this
service
for
this
I
must
say
to
you
if
her
Majesty
fail
with
such
supply
and
maintenance
as
shall be
fit
all
she
has
done
hitherto
will be
utterly
lost
and
cast
away
and
we
her
poor
subjects
no
better
than
objects

And
good
my
Lord
for
my
last
have
me
only
thus
far
in
your
care
that
in
these
things
which
her
Majesty
and
you
all
have
agreed
and
confirmed
for
me
to
do
that
I
be
not
made
a
metamorphosis
that
I
shall
not
know
what
to
do

And
so
the
Lord
have
you
in
his
keeping
preserve
her
Majesty
for
ever
and
send
me
good
speed
in
this
service

in
some
haste
this
5th
of
December
on
my
way
to
the
sea
side
by
your
Lordship’s
assured
friend
R
Leicester

To
the
right
honourable
my
very
good
Lord
the
Lord
Burley
Lord
treasurer
of
England

Mr
secretary
I
came
hither
to
the
Hay
upon
Monday
last
where
I
was
very
honourably
received
all
the
states
being
assembled
together
for
that
purpose
to
make
as
much
shew
as
they
could
devise
of
their
good
wills
to
her
Majesty
as
in
many
orations
pageants
and
such
like
was
expressed
beside
the
people
with
great
joy
cried
God
save
the
Queen
God
save
the
Queen
in
every
place
of
the
streets
as
I
passed

The
next
day
all
the
whole
states
general
came
to
me
and
there
openly
again
there
Chancellor
Leonius
(
some
call
him
Longonius
made
a
long
oration
in
thanks
and
praises
to
the
Queen’s
Majesty
for
her
great
clemency
bounty
and
goodness
showed
to
these
poor
afflicted
countries
attributing
all
their
good
and
happiness
under
God
to
her
Majesty
only

As
soon
as
he
had
done
than
came
commissioners
from
particular
provinces
as
from
Utrecht
Geldars
and
Fresland
besides
sundry
special
towns
as
Amsterdam
Leiden
Auchuson
and
others
all
which
must
needs
use
there
gratulation
with
orations
as
the
other
deed
and
much
to
the
same
effect
all
with
thanks
and
praise
to
her
Majesty

At
all
this
ceremonydoing
was
there
a
French
secretary
sent
hither
5
or
6
days
before
with
letters
from
the
King

He
said
it
was
about
merchants
matters
but
in
deed
contrary
only
to
have
impeached
if
he
could
this
bending
themselves
to
her
majesty
as
they
do

But
the
states
gave
him
no
audience
all
the
while
alleging
they
were
occupied
about
the
service
of
the
Queen
of
England
which
they
would
dispatch
before
all
princes
in
the
world

This
fellow
being
present
at
all
this
solemn
dealing
with
me
took
it
in
such
snuff
as
he
came
proudly
to
the
states
and
offered
his
letters
saying
"
Now
I
trust
you
have
done
all
your
sacrifices
to
the
Queen
of
England
and
may
yield
me
some
leisure
to
read
my
masters
letters

And
both
roundly
and
frankly
they
go
to
work
that
you
shall
see
they
will
do
indeed
more
than
ever
they
promised
considering
her
Majesty’s
denial
of
the
sovereignty
and
name
of
protector

For
they
mean
and
must
do
it
for
the
whole
people
will
have
it
that
her
Majesty
shall
have
in
her
hands
the
whole
bestowing
as well
of
there
money
and
contributions
as
of
there
men
of
war
and
the
desire
no
longer
her
good
favour
to
them
than
they
shall
deal
in
all
sincerity
with
her

Wherein
it
appears
that
all
the
commissioners
have
wonderfully
set
fourth
her
Majesty
to
them
all
here
and
Paul
Buys
has
done
his
part
thoroughly
so
has
Walk
also

And
all
things
already
are
carried
on
with
the
most
universal
obedience
of
her
Majesty’s
name
that
ever
I
saw

And
flatly
it
appears
now
they
will
no
other
authority
but
under
her
Majesty
nor
that
heir
treasure
nor
lives
shall be
at
the
disposing
of
any
but
her
Majesty
which
if
you
saw
that
we
see
here
you
would
wonder
at
what
these
people
do
and
are
able
to
do
and
if
God
had
not
moved
her
Majesty
to
send
when
she
did
the
prince
of
Parma
had
been
by
this
time
in
the
best
and
greatest
towns
they
have
but
you
shall
hear
others
in
this
and
not
me

And
as
I
wrote
before
how
her
Majesty’s
dealings
here
are
already
blown
into
Germany
so
this
day
the
elector
brought
me
letters
again
newly
come
there
whereby
they
write
most
honourably
of
her
Majesty
and
the
Duke
of
Sax
gives
much
better
eye
than
he
did
since
his
wife’s
death
and
like
to
marry
again
with
the
house
of
Hanalt
a
great
protestant
and
a
great
house

He
has
sent
to
speak
with
Seiguro
and
very
like
to
join
with
the
other
princes
who
are
agreed
not
only
to
send
a
messenger
to
the
French
King
but
to
let
him
now
that
they
will
come
to
the
aid
of
the
King
of
Navare
who
is
most
enviously
dealt
withal
by
the
practice
of
the
pope
and
King
of
Spain

The
elector
vowed
to
me
that
they
have
done
more
in
these
causes
within
this
20
days
since
they
understood
of
her
Majesty’s
resolution
against
the
King
of
Spain
as well
by
Sir
Francis
Drakes
going
into
the
Indies
as
her
sending
into
these
countries
than
they
have
don
this
10
years
or
would
have
don
this
twelvemonths
yet

It
is
told
me
by
the
elector
that
divers
of
them
mean
to
send
hither
to
me
to
congratulate
her
Majesty’s
gracious
doings
toward
his
country

I
have
no
other
nuesytull
these
states
have
fully
ended
their
consultations
which
will be
to
morrow
as
I
hear
and
wholly
without
contradiction
to
be
at
the
devotion
and
disposition
of
her
majesty
absolutely

Of
this
you
shall
hear
as
soon
as
I
shall
know
there
further
answer

Two
of
our
men
of
war
of
Flushing
has
taken
2
Dunkirk
men
one
sank
and
drowned
all
the
soldiers
and
mariners

Thus
fare
you
well
sir
this
last
of
December

Your
assured
friend
R.
Leicester

It
is
said
that
the
princes
are
resolved
to
entreat
Cassymere
to
be
general
and
shall
have
25000
men
levied
by
the
princes
to
go
with
him
into
France

Mr
secretary
as
you
shall
shortly
hear
of
our
whole
proceedings
by
Mr.
Davyson
so
must
I
entreat
you
most
earnestly
even
as
the
well
doing
of
my
poor
service
here
may
be
tendered
but
specially
for
the
honour
and
service
of
her
Majesty
that
you
will
be
meanes
that
there
may
be
a
good
quantity
of
money
sent
over
as
there
is
behind
of
the
whole

It
shall be
the
worst
and
the
most
she
shall be
charged
with
but
at
the
beginning
20000
pounds

shall
stand
in
more
stead
than
40000
pounds

4
months
hence
and
I
am
well
persuaded
as
you
shall
see
at
Mr
Davyson’s
coming
that
they
here
have
good
means
to
maintain
there
wars
and
when
we
make
reckoning
at
home
of
a
defensible
war
it
must
be
so
defensible
as
we
must
be
able
to
have
always
6
or
70000
men
horse
and
footmen
to
front
the
enemy
who
all
this
hard
weather
has
gone
from
place
to
place
with
4000
footmen
and
1500
horse
and
at
this
day
he
keeps
the
field
and
has
put
in
danger
3
or
4
towns
of
great
importance
as
Brabe
Wenloe
Vianna
and
Bomeley
as
also
now
he
is
come
upon
Zeland
side
and
will
do
what
he
can
to
Lylle
and
Lyskinshook
where
there
has
been
much
decay
of
soldier
but
there
is
doing
all
that
is
possible
for
defence
for
otherwise
we
are
no
way
able
to
resist
them
which
they
know
and
does
make
them
presume
the
more
at
this
time

But
the
states
have
agreed
and
do
find
there
is
no
remedy
but
we
must
erect
a
camp
to
bridle
this
liberty
of
the
enemy
or
else
he
will
keep
a
war
this
20
year
and
make
us
all
weary
and
this
way
being
taken
I
warrant
you
we
will
shortly
weary
him
as
well
and
yet
never
hazard
any
battle
which
he
will
be
as
loath
to
come
to
as
we

I
am
in
hope
of
an
enterprise
to
take
place
shortly
which
you
will be
glad
to
hear
of

God
send
it
to
fall
out
as
I
look
for
and
that
you
may
provide
us
speedily
with
a
good
some
of
money
being
all
one
to
her
Majesty
and
I
will
undertake
she
shall
come
to
no
further
charge
whatsoever

I
will
help
to
ease
her
before
the
end
of
a
good
part
of
this
if
she
do
but
continue
her
favour
and
good
countenance
to
this
cause
only
as
I
trust
she
will
or
else
she
knows
not
the
lack
she
will
find
of
the
friendship
of
these
countries

As
upon
my
honour
and
truth
to
you
they
were
almost
utterly
gone
if
I
had
not
arrived
when
I
did

To
my
very
honourable
good
friend
Sir
Francis
Walsingham
knight
principal
secretary
to
her
Majesty

My
dear
Brother
I
would
you
knew
(
though
not
felt
the
extreme
dolor
that
overwhelms
my
mind
for
that
miserable
accident
which
(
far
contrary
to
my
meanings
has
befallen

I
have
now
sent
this
kinsman
of
mine
whom
ere
now
it
has
pleased
you
to
favour
to
instruct
you
truly
of
that
which
is
too
irksome
for
my
pen
to
tell
you

I
beseech
you
that
as
God
and
many
more
know
how
innocent
I
am
in
this
case
so
you
will
believe
me
that
if
I
had
bid
aught
I
would
have
abidden
by
it

I
am
not
so
base
minded
that
fear
of
any
living
creature
or
prince
should
make
me
afraid
to
do
that
were
just
or
do
to
deny
the
same

I
am
not
of
so
base
a
lineage
nor
carry
so
vile
a
mind

But
as
not
to
disguise
fits
not
a
King
so
will
I
never
dissemble
my
actions
but
cause
them
show
even
as
I
meant
them

Thus
assuring
yourself
of
me
that
as
I
know
this
was
deserved
yet
if
I
had
meant
it
I
would
never
lay
it
on
others
shoulders
no
more
will
I
not
damnify
my
self
that
thought
it
not

And
who
shall
otherwise
persuade
you
judge
them
more
partially
to
others
than
you

And
thus
in
haste
I
leave
to
trouble
you
beseeching
God
to
send
you
a
long
reign

The
14th
of
Feb.
1586

Your
most
assured
loving
sister
and
cousin
Elizabeth
R.
My
very
good
Lord
I
now
remain
aboard
the
Bear
and
as
yet
the
provisions
for
the
ships
could
not
be
taken
all
in
by
reason
of
the
weather
which
has
been
so
tempestuous
as
that
no
boats
could
lie
aboard
them
to
put
in
the
same
yet
I
hope
that
within
two
or
three
days
all
things
will
be
in
a
readiness

Here
is
a
very
sufficient
and
able
company
of
sailors
as
ever
were
seen
and
because
their
long
journeys
out
of
all
places
of
this
realm
and
this
bad
season
makes
them
unprovided
of
apparel
and
such
necessaries
it
were
good
for
their
relief
to
pay
them
one
month's
wages
before
hand

Many
great
charges
extraordinary
has
grown
this
quarter
which
I
could
hardly
have
believed
unless
with
mine
own
eyes
and
good
examination
I
had
seen

Wherefore
in
respect
of
those
causes
and
for
the
furtherance
of
service
I
am
to
entreat
your
good
Lordship
to
give
order
that
the
rest
of
the
warrant
lately
granted
for
the
whole
navy
may
be
paid
to
Mr
Hawkyns
and
2.000
more
upon
the
old
warrant
of
29.000
for
the
furnishing
of
those
extraordinary
charges
wherein
your
Lordship
shall
further
a
good
service

We
have
entered
into
sea
victuals
this
day
being
the
22nd
of
this
instant
December
and
not
before
for
the
preserving
of
the
six
weeks'
victuals

And
so
I
bid
your
good
Lordship
most
heartily
farewell

From
aboard
the
Bear
the
22d
of
December
1587

Your
Lordship's
most
assured
loving
friend
to
command
C

Howard

My
honourable
good
Lord
I
do
understand
by
Mr.
Cæsar
how
much
I
am
bound
unto
your
Lordship
for
your
honourable
favour

I
have
no
ways
to
recompense
it
but
with
my
love
and
service
which
your
Lordship
shall
be
most
assured
ever
of

It
may
be
there
has
been
some
report
made
to
your
Lordship
of
some
chance
that
happened
here
before
my
coming
down
by
fire
in
one
of
the
ships
and
because
I
do
understand
that
it
is
reported
that
it
should
be
done
by
Ascott
I
do
assure
your
Lordship
it
was
after
this
manner

There
were
two
poor
knaves
that
came
from
Westchester
that
strifed
for
a
place
to
hang
up
their
netting
for
to
lie
in
and
the
one
of
them
had
a
piece
of
a
candle
in
his
hand
and
in
striving
the
candle
fell
down
where
there
lay
some
oakum

I
am
bold
to
send
you
by
this
bearer
my
man
the
copy
of
a
proclamation
which
I
have
drawn
and
proclaimed
in
my
own
ship
and
shall
be
this
day
and
drawer
of
a
proclamation
but
it
shall
serve
I
hope
for
to
prevent
some
ill
that
might
happen

My
good
Lord
this
bearer
my
man
shall
always
attend
at
the
court
and
shall
attend
on
your
Lordship
always
to
know
your
pleasure
if
you
will
command
him
anything
unto
me

And
so
resting
always
most
beholden
unto
your
Lordship
and
most
ready
to
do
your
Lordship
any
service
I
humbly
take
my
leave

Aboard
her
Majesty's
good
ship
the
White
Bear
the
24th
of
December
1587

Your
Lordship's
most
assured
to
command
C

Howard

My
honourable
and
good
Lord
--
I
have
received
your
Lordship's
favourable
letter
and
am
much
bound
unto
your
Lordship
for
your
Lordship's
favours

I
would
to
God
your
Lordship's
health
and
strength
were
answerable
to
your
mind
then
I
am
sure
this
company
here
with
me
should
be
happy
to
see
your
Lordship
here

My
Lord
we
can
bring
all
the
ships
that
her
Majesty
has
aground
there
in
3
springs

I
know
not
that
we
can
do
so
in
any
place
else
but
here
at
Chatham

That
which
is
adoing
above
the
town
will
be
to
very
good
purpose
for
any
sudden
attack
and
for
my
part
I
wish
it
were
as
strong
as
Flushing

I
received
a
letter
from
my
Lord
Cobham
of
an
enterprise
that
is
sent
down
to
burn
all
such
ships
of
her
Majesty's
as
shall
ride
before
the
Rammekens
or
thereabouts

I
received
this
letter
as
I
was
half
the
way
coming
homewards
from
Harwich

I
presently
sent
away
a
pinnace
with
John
Wynter
in
her
your
Lordship's
servant
and
did
send
the
advertisement
unto
Sir
William
Russell
with
a
letter
of
my
own
and
likewise
I
did
write
unto
the
captains
of
her
Majesty's
ships
with
certain
instructions
which
if
the
device
be
attempted
I
believe
you
shall
hear
they
shall
smart
for
their
device

There
is
two
ships
and
a
pinnace
their
victuals
comes
out
about
an
eight
days
hence
so
that
then
they
will
come
away

In
the
meantime
if
nothing
be
done
already
I
doubt
not
but
they
shall
safely
come
away

Your
Lordship's
most
assured
always
to
command
C

Howard

Sir
I
most
humbly
thank
you
for
your
letters

I
cannot
tell
what
to
think
of
my
brother
Stafford's
advertisement
for
if
it
be
true
that
the
King
of
Spain's
forces
be
dissolved
I
would
not
wish
the
Queen's
Majesty
to
be
at
this
charges
that
she
is
at
but
if
it
be
but
a
device
knowing
that
a
little
thing
makes
us
too
careless
then
I
know
not
what
may
come
of
it

But
this
I
am
sure
of
if
her
Majesty
would
have
spent
but
a
1,000
crowns
to
have
had
some
intelligence
it
would
have
saved
her
twenty
times
as
much

Assure
yourself
he
knows
what
we
do
here
and
if
the
army
be
or
do
dissolve
it
is
the
preparation
that
her
Majesty
has
made
that
is
the
cause
for
he
cannot
abide
this
heat
that
is
provided
for
him

He
did
never
think
that
he
would
thus
have
provided
for
his
coming
but
that
the
number
of
false
alarums
that
he
has
given
her
Majesty
would
have
made
her
to
have
taken
no
alarum
and
so
to
have
had
the
vantage
and
the
chopping
up
of
his
friends
here
I
am
sure
he
does
not
like
and
if
they
be
up
I
wish
they
should
continue
so
till
there
be
a
good
peace
which
I
pray
to
God
to
send
us

Sir
if
your
next
advertisements
do
assure
the
dissolving
of
the
army
in
Spain
then
it
were
good
we
did
so
here
yet
if
the
Duke
of
Parma
continue
his
and
that
there
be
any
doubt
of
anything
intended
for
Scotland
put
but
three
or
four
more
ships
to
them
in
the
Narrow
Seas
and
I
dare
assure
you
it
shall
beat
any
power
he
shall
be
able
to
make
and
impeach
him
of
any
attempt
in
Scotland
and
I
will
take
upon
me
the
service
myself
for
I
assure
you
it
does
grieve
me
to
see
her
Majesty
at
more
charges
than
is
needful
and
this
charge
will
not
be
great

And
so
I
pray
you
to
write
me
frankly
for
I
do
assure
you
I
will
take
it
kindly
and
friendly
at
your
hands
and
think
myself
much
beholden
unto
you
for
it
for
I
may
sometimes
upon
a
good
conceit
in
my
opinion
make
such
a
journey
as
I
did
now
to
Harwich
and
yet
it
may
not
be
so
well
taken
there
but
I
know
no
cause
why
it
should
be
but
well
taken

I
do
assure
you
on
my
honour
it
cost
not
the
Queen's
Majesty
one
halfpenny
nor
shall
not
when
I
make
any
such
journey

I
will
rather
spend
myself
one
hundred
pounds
than
to
spend
her
one
penny

Thus
good
Mr.
Secretary
I
am
bold
with
you
as
my
special
good
friend
and
so
bid
you
most
heartily
farewell
and
God
send
you
health
and
strength

From
the
Bear
the
24th
of
January

Your
assured
loving
friend
to
use
C

Howard

Sir
I
most
heartily
thank
you
for
your
letter
and
for
your
advertisements

There
happened
a
mischance
in
one
of
his
ships
at
Portsmouth
that
a
piece
broke
and
killed
a
man
with
some
other
hurt

If
you
would
write
a
word
or
two
unto
him
to
spare
his
powder
it
would
do
well

Sir
I
send
you
herewith
enclosed
all
the
copies
of
the
letters
from
my
Lord
Chamberlain
again
which
I
most
heartily
thank
you
for
and
I
pray
to
God
the
Scottish
King
do
deceive
me
but
I
am
afraid
he
will
not

For
my
own
part
I
have
made
of
the
French
King
the
Scottish
King
and
the
King
of
Spain
a
Trinity
that
I
mean
never
to
trust
to
be
saved
by
and
I
would
others
were
in
that
of
my
opinion

Sir
there
was
never
since
England
was
England
such
a
stratagem
and
mask
made
to
deceive
England
withal
as
this
is
of
the
treaty
of
peace

I
pray
God
we
have
not
cause
to
remember
one
thing
that
was
made
of
the
Scots
by
the
Englishmen
that
we
do
not
curse
for
this
a
long
grey
beard
with
a
white
head
witless
that
will
make
all
the
world
think
us
heartless

You
know
whom
I
mean

I
have
received
a
letter
from
Sir
Henry
Palmer
that
there
is
at
Dunkirk
divers
hoys
and
lighters
that
be
filled
with
ballast
and
great
stones
surely
means
for
the
stopping
of
some
haven

Sir
if
there
be
at
any
time
any
matter
of
importance
wherein
I
may
do
any
service
there
with
you
I
can
be
quickly
there
and
here
again

I
pray
you
Sir
let
it
be
thought
on
as
you
see
cause
upon
your
advertisements
it
will
ask
a
good
time
to
furnish
our
fleet
again
with
men
as
they
were

I
do
not
look
to
see
it
ever
bettered

I
pray
God
it
be
as
well
when
there
shall
be
cause

And
so
giving
you
most
hearty
thanks
for
your
most
friendly
dealing
with
me
in
all
causes
and
your
friendly
remembrance
I
bid
you
most
heartily
farewell

From
aboard
her
Majesty's
good
ship
the
White
Bear
the
27th
of
January
1587

Your
assured
loving
friend
C

HOWARD

He
has
the
charge
of
all
my
soldiers
in
my
ship
and
has
done
his
duty
very
well

I
hope
he
will
answer
all
honestly
and
well

Sir
if
the
commissioners
be
once
gone
over
and
that
there
be
a
surcease
of
arms
it
shall
be
but
folly
and
to
no
purpose
for
me
to
lie
here

I
think
both
I
and
the
noblemen
leaving
sufficient
lieutenants
in
our
ships
and
the
officers
as
Sir
W.
Wynter
Mr.
Hawkyns
and
Mr.
Borough
remain
here
with
the
navy
will
be
sufficient
for
before
these
ships
can
have
their
full
number
of
men
again
it
will
be
a
month
to
gather
them
do
what
we
can

And
I
pray
to
God
we
have
them
when
we
shall
need
for
many
are
gone
abroad
and
specially
the
chiefest
men
God
send
me
to
see
such
a
company
together
again
when
need
is

I
protest
it
before
God
I
write
not
this
to
you
because
I
am
weary
with
being
here
for
if
it
were
not
for
her
Majesty's
presence
I
had
rather
live
in
the
company
of
these
noble
ships
than
in
any
place

And
yet
would
I
be
glad
that
there
were
something
to
do

I
am
more
sorrier
for
the
noblemen
than
any
ways
for
myself
for
I
would
have
them
save
to
spend
when
need
shall
be

I
think
it
will
be
a
most
fittest
time
to
ground
our
ships
in
for
now
at
our
coming
out
it
was
you
know
on
such
a
sudden
as
we
could
not
ground
but
two
or
three
of
the
middle
sort
so
as
the
great
ships
were
not
grounded

I
have
with
the
advice
of
the
officers
and
masters
thought
good
to
begin
with
some
the
next
spring
and
so
in
a
three
springs
dispatch
them
all
and
have
them
all
in
most
excellent
order
by
the
midst
of
March
all
save
the
men
and
I
doubt
not
but
the
ships
shall
prove
some
notable
liars
and
if
cause
fall
out
do
a
better
day
of
service
for
England
than
ever
ships
did
for
it
yet

But
this
assure
yourself
if
the
forces
of
Spain
do
come
before
the
midst
of
April
there
will
be
as
much
ado
to
have
men
to
furnish
us
as
ever
was
but
men
must
have
or
else
the
ships
will
do
no
good

God
knows
it
is
but
a
bare
sight
to
see
us
now
to
that
it
was
and
I
would
not
wish
any
to
take
the
pains
to
come
to
see
us
till
we
are
newly
supplied
when
cause
shall
be

Sir
God
send
you
well
to
do
and
continuance
of
your
health
and
so
I
bid
you
most
heartily
farewell

From
aboard
her
Majesty's
good
ship
the
Bear
the
28th
of
January

Your
assured
loving
friend
C

HOWARD

For
Mr.
Hawkyns'
bargain
he
is
presently
to
repair
to
the
Court
where
he
shall
be
best
able
to
answer
in
his
own
defence
but
this
much
I
will
say
to
your
Lordship
I
have
been
aboard
of
every
ship
that
goes
out
with
me
and
in
every
place
where
any
may
creep
and
I
do
thank
God
that
they
be
in
the
estate
they
be
in
and
there
is
never
a
one
of
them
that
knows
what
a
leak
means

I
have
known
when
an
admiral
of
England
has
gone
out
and
two
ships
in
fleet
could
not
say
so

There
is
none
that
goes
out
now
but
I
durst
go
to
the
Rio
de
la
Plata
in
her
and
yet
the
Mary
Rose
and
the
Swallow
be
with
me
who
were
ships
in
the
King's
Majesty's
her
father's
time

And
therefore
I
dare
presume
greatly
that
those
that
have
been
made
in
her
Majesty's
time
be
very
good
and
serviceable
and
shall
prove
them
arrant
liars
that
have
reported
the
contrary

And
I
thank
God
her
Majesty
I
hope
may
be
well
assured
of
their
goodness
yet
everything
has
his
time
and
must
be
helped
as
need
requires

My
Lord
I
had
no
meaning
to
carry
away
all
the
officers

I
have
none
with
me
but
Sir
W.
Wynter

I
leave
Mr.
Hawkyns
and
Mr.
Borough
behind
to
wait
on
your
Lordship
and
to
put
the
four
great
ships
in
readiness
which
we
shall
greatly
need
if
the
Spanish
forces
come
out

Your
Lordship's
most
assured
to
command
C

HOWARD

The
absence
of
my
Lord
Admiral
most
gracious
Sovereign
has
emboldened
me
to
put
my
pen
to
the
paper

On
Friday
last
upon
good
consideration
we
left
the
army
of
Spain
so
far
to
the
northwards
as
they
could
neither
recover
England
nor
Scotland

And
within
three
days
after
we
were
entertained
with
a
great
storm
considering
the
time
of
the
year
the
which
storm
in
many
of
your
judgements
has
not
a
little
annoyed
the
enemy's
army

If
the
wind
hinder
it
not
I
think
they
are
forced
to
Denmark
and
that
for
divers
causes

Certain
it
is
that
many
of
their
people
were
sick
and
not
a
few
killed

Their
ships
sails
ropes
and
masts
needs
great
reparations
for
that
they
had
all
felt
of
your
Majesty's
force

Your
Highness's
enemies
are
many
yet
God
has
and
will
hear
your
Majesty's
prayers
putting
your
hand
to
the
plough
for
the
defence
of
his
truth
as
your
Majesty
has
begun

God
for
his
Christ’s
sake
bless
your
sacred
Majesty
now
and
ever

Written
aboard
your
Majesty's
very
good
ship
the
Revenge
this
8th
of
August
1588

Your
Majesty's
faithful
vassal
FRA.
DRAKE

Most
Honourable
The
army
of
Spain
I
think
certainly
to
be
put
either
with
Norway
or
Denmark

There
are
divers
causes
which
moves
me
so
to
think

The
first
we
understand
by
divers
prisoners
which
we
have
taken
that
generally
through
all
their
whole
fleet
there
was
no
one
ship
free
of
sick
people

Secondly
their
ships
masts
sails
and
ropes
were
very
much
decayed
and
spoiled
by
our
great
shot

And
I
assure
myself
that
whenever
her
Majesty
shall
hear
of
their
arrival
in
any
of
these
coasts
that
her
Highness
shall
be
advertised
both
of
their
great
distress
and
of
no
small
loss
amongst
them
for
I
assure
your
Honour
her
Majesty's
good
ships
felt
much
of
that
storm
and
lost
many
of
their
boats
and
pinnaces
with
some
anchors
and
cables
yet
were
we
fair
by
our
own
shore
and
the
wind
right
off
the
land

Some
amongst
us
will
not
let
to
say
that
they
are
in
Scotland

I
cannot
think
so
for
that
we
had
no
wind
whereby
they
were
able
to
recover
any
place
of
the
mainland
of
Scotland
without
it
were
some
of
the
out
isles
which
are
no
meet
places
to
relieve
their
so
many
great
wants

Norway
or
the
out
isles
of
Scotland
can
relieve
them
but
with
water
and
a
few
cows
or
bad
beef
and
some
small
quantity
of
goats
and
hens
which
is
to
them
as
nothing

And
yet
these
bad
reliefs
are
to
be
had
but
in
few
places
and
their
roads
dangerous

The
only
thing
which
is
to
be
looked
for
is
that
if
they
should
go
to
the
King
of
Denmark
and
there
have
his
friendship
and
help
for
all
their
reliefs
none
can
better
help
their
wants
in
all
these
parts
than
he
for
that
he
is
a
Prince
of
great
shipping
and
can
best
supply
his
wants
which
now
the
Duke
of
Medina
the
Sidonia
stands
in
need
of
as
great
anchors
cables
masts
ropes
and
victuals
and
what
the
King
of
Spain's
hot
crowns
will
do
in
cold
countries
for
mariners
and
men
I
leave
to
your
good
Lordship
which
can
best
judge
thereof

We
left
a
pinnace
of
her
Majesty's
the
Advice
and
a
fine
caravel
of
my
own
to
attend
the
fleet
of
Spain
when
we
left
them
but
what
is
become
of
them
in
that
great
storm
or
whether
they
may
be
stayed
in
any
other
country
as
they
may
I
know
not

My
poor
opinion
is
that
it
were
most
meet
to
send
a
good
ship
and
some
fine
bark
with
some
very
sufficient
person
to
deal
effectually
from
her
Majesty
with
the
King
of
Denmark
as
he
shall
find
the
cause
to
require
and
to
send
the
true
report
back
with
all
speed
possible
that
they
may
be
the
better
prevented
for
no
doubt
but
that
which
they
are
able
to
do
they
will
presently
put
it
in
execution

The
Prince
of
Parma
I
take
him
to
be
as
a
bear
robbed
of
her
whelps
and
no
doubt
but
being
so
great
a
soldier
as
he
is
that
he
will
presently
if
he
may
undertake
some
great
matter
for
his
rest
will
stand
now
thereupon

It
is
for
certain
that
the
Duke
of
sidonia
stands
somewhat
jealous
of
him
and
the
Spaniards
begin
to
hate
him
their
honour
being
touched
so
near
many
of
their
lives
spentI
assure
your
Honour
not
so
little
as
five
thousand
men
less
than
when
first
we
saw
them
near
Plymouth
divers
of
their
ships
sunk
and
taken
and
they
have
nothing
to
say
for
themselves
in
excuse
but
that
they
came
to
the
place
appointed
which
was
at
Calais
and
there
stayed
the
Duke
of
Parma's
coming
above
24
hours
you
and
until
they
were
fired
thence

So
this
is
my
poor
conclusion

If
we
may
recover
near
Dunkirk
this
night
or
to-morrow
morning
so
as
their
power
may
see
us
returned
from
the
chase
and
ready
to
encounter
them
if
they
once
sally
that
the
next
news
you
shall
hear
will
be
the
one
to
mutiny
against
the
other
which
when
that
shall
come
to
pass
or
whether
they
mutiny
or
no
let
us
all
with
one
consent
both
high
and
low
magnify
and
praise
our
most
gracious
and
merciful
God
for
his
infinite
and
unspeakable
goodness
towards
us
which
I
protest
to
your
good
Lordships
that
my
belief
is
that
our
most
gracious
Sovereign
her
poor
subjects
and
the
Church
of
God
has
opened
the
heavens
in
divers
places
and
pierced
the
ears
of
our
most
merciful
father
unto
whom
in
Christ
Jesu
be
all
honour
and
glory

so
be
it
Amen
Amen

Written
with
much
haste
for
that
we
are
ready
to
set
sail
to
prevent
the
Duke
of
Parma
this
southerly
wind
if
it
please
God
for
truly
my
poor
opinion
is
that
we
should
have
a
great
eye
unto
him

From
her
Majesty's
very
good
ship
the
Revenge
this
10th
of
August
1588

Your
Honour's
faithfully
to
be
commanded
always
FRA.
DRAKE

Yet
would
I
willingly
see
it

Your
Honour's
ever
FRA.
DRAKE

Most
Honourable
The
sudden
sending
for
of
my
very
good
Lord
my
Lord
Admiral
has
caused
me
to
scribble
these
few
lines

First
most
humbly
beseeching
your
Honour
to
deliver
this
letter
unto
her
Majesty
as
a
testification
of
my
Lord
Admiral's
most
honourable
using
of
me
in
this
action
where
it
has
pleased
his
good
Lordship
to
accept
of
that
which
I
have
sometimes
spoken
and
commended
that
little
service
which
I
was
able
much
better
than
in
either
of
them
both
I
was
able
to
deserve

Wherein
if
I
have
not
performed
as
much
as
was
looked
for
yet
I
persuade
myself
his
good
Lordship
will
confess
I
have
been
dutiful

Touching
any
other
causes
that
either
has
been
done
or
is
to
be
done
let
me
pray
pardon
of
your
Honour
for
I
assure
your
Honour
that
my
Lord
Admiral
has
so
sufficiently
instructed
himself
daily
as
I
faithfully
believe
his
good
Lordship
will
thoroughly
satisfy
her
Majesty
and
your
Honours
what
is
now
best
to
be
done

Thus
humbly
taking
my
leave
I
beseech
God
to
bless
the
work
of
her
Majesty's
hands
always

Written
aboard
her
Majesty's
good
ship
the
Revenge
at
midnight
this
11th
of
August
1588

Which
reports
are
quite
contrary

My
poor
opinion
is
that
if
their
fleet
chance
to
return
it
is
altogether
for
that
the
wind
will
not
permit
them
good
passage
to
go
about
the
other
way
at
this
time
of
the
year
because
it
is
most
subject
to
westerly
winds

This
wind
that
now
blows
if
it
be
not
more
easterly
there
than
it
is
here
could
hardly
permit
such
a
fleet
for
that
they
shall
feel
a
great
wind
for
to
set
sail
to
pass
on
the
back
side
of
Scotland
and
Ireland
which
may
be
the
cause
that
of
necessity
they
must
be
forced
this
way
for
Spain

Farther
my
judgement
is
that
the
Duke
of
Siding
with
his
fleet
shall
needs
jump
with
fair
weather
the
highest
of
a
spring
with
good
wind
and
the
Duke
of
Parma
embarking
all
in
one
day

This
were
very
meet
for
them
for
if
any
one
of
these
fail
them
they
shall
never
perform
as
much
as
they
have
promised
to
the
King
their
master

My
reason
is
this

The
most
part
of
the
ships
of
the
Duke
of
Parma
are
small
and
being
pestered
with
men
of
war
must
of
necessity
have
fair
weather
and
--
as
I
am
credibly
given
to
understand
--
they
must
have
a
spring
to
bring
their
shipping
both
out
of
Dunkirk
Nieuport
and
Sluys

Now
for
the
Duke
of
medina
his
fleet
there
is
no
harbour
for
them
upon
that
coast
so
that
to
stir
it
requires
fair
weather
which
when
it
happen
that
we
should
find
there
he
is
like
God
willing
to
have
unquiet
rest

I
would
advertise
your
Honour
of
some
defects
in
her
Majesty's
army
but
that
my
very
good
Lord
the
Lord
Admiral
has
written
unto
your
Honour
thereof
at
large

This
is
my
poor
opinion
of
her
Majesty's
army
that
the
threatening
of
the
enemy
will
put
a
great
part
of
their
weakness
from
her
Majesty's
good
subjects
and
no
doubt
but
they
will
fight
valiantly

although
I
find
my
Lord
Admiral
well
affected
when
fair
weather
is
to
go
for
the
coast
of
Flanders
yet
I
would
your
Honour
should
animate
us
forward
for
there
are
many
causes
that
might
move
us
to
be
there
more
than
we
are
and
much
better
for
us
and
better
service

Thus
humbly
taking
my
leave
of
your
Honour
I
rest
desiring
God
to
give
us
all
grace
to
live
in
his
fear
so
shall
we
not
need
greatly
to
fear
the
enemy

From
aboard
her
Majesty's
very
good
ship
the
Revenge
this
23rd
of
August
1588

Your
Honour's
most
willing
to
be
commanded
FRA.
DRAKE

I
have
sent
to
your
Honour
a
copy
Englished
out
of
a
letter
sent
from
Don
Pedro
de
Valdes
to
the
King
his
master
which
does
deliver
the
time
of
their
victualling
and
of
some
discontentment
which
was
between
the
Duke
and
him

Let
me
humbly
beseech
your
Honour
that
we
may
be
put
in
mind
here
that
it
were
good
we
saw
the
coast
of
Flanders
as
often
as
we
might

God
bless
us
all
and
give
us
grace
to
fear
his
justice

I
crave
pardon

I
have
no
time
to
read
that
which
I
have
caused
to
be
written

Your
Honour's
faithfully
FRA.

To
those
gentlemen
his

acquaintance
that

their

plays
R.

wishes
a
better
exercise
and
wisdom
to
prevent
his
extremities

If
woeful
experience
may
move
you
gentlemen
to
beware
or
unheardof
wretchedness
entreat
you
to
take
heed
I
doubt
not
but
you
will
look
back
with
sorrow
on
your
time
past
and
endeavour
with
repentance
to
spend
that
which
is
to
come

Wonder
not
(
for
with
the
will
I
first
begin
thou
famous
gracer
of
tragedians
that
Green
who
has
said
with
the
like
the
fool
in
his
heart
"
There
is
no
God"

Is
it
pestilent
Machiavellian
policy
that
thou
haste
studied
O
peevish
folly

what
are
his
rules
but
mere
confused
mockeries
able
to
extirpate
in
small
time
the
generation
of
mankind

for

sic
volo

in
those
that
are
able
to
command
and
if
it
be
lawful
fas
et
nefas
to
do
any
thing
that
is
beneficial
only
truants
should
possess
the
earth
and
they
striving
to
exceed
in
tyranny
should
each
to
other
be
a
slaughterman
till
the
mightiest
outliving
all
one
stroke
were
left
for
death
that
in
one
age
man’s
life
should
end

The
broacher
of
this
diabolical
atheism
is
dead
and
in
his
life
had
never
the
felicity
he
aimed
at
but
as
he
began
in
craft
lived
in
fear
and
ended
in
despair

Quam
inscrutabilia

This
murderer
of
many
brethren
had
his
conscience
seared
like
Cayne
this
betrayer
of
him
that
gave
his
life
for
him
inherited
the
portion
of
Judas
this
apostate
perished
as
ill
as
Julian
and
wilt
thou
my
friend
be
his
disciple
look
unto
me
by
him
persuaded
to
that
liberty
and
thou
shall
find
it
an
infernal
bondage

I
know
the
least
of
my
demerits
merit
this
miserable
death
but
wilful
striving
against
known
truth
exceeds
all
the
terrors
of
my
soul

Defer
not
with
me
till
this
last
point
of
extremity
for
little
knows
thou
how
in
the
end
thou
shall
be
visited

Stop
shallow
water
still
running
it
will
rage
tread
on
a
worm
and
it
will
turn
then
blame
not
scholars
who
are
vexed
with
sharp
and
bitter
lines
if
they
reprove
thy
too
much
liberty
of
reproof

And
thou
no
less
desiring
then
the
other
two
in
some
things
rarer
in
nothing
inferior
driven
as
myself
to
extreme
shifts
a
little
have
I
to
say
to
the
and
were
it
not
an
idolatrous
oath
I
would
swear
by
sweet
S.
George
thou
art
unworthy
better
hap
since
thou
depend
on
so
mean
a
stay

Baseminded
men
all
three
of
you
if
by
my
misery
you
be
not
warned
for
unto
none
of
you
like
me
sought
those
burs
to
cleave
those
puppets
I
mean
that
speak
from
our
mouths
those
antics
garnished
in
our
colours

Is
it
not
strange
that
I
to
whom
they
all
have
been
beholding
is
it
not
like
that
you
to
whom
they
all
have
been
beholding
shall
were
you
in
that
case
that
I
am
now
be
both
of
them
at
once
forsaken

Yes
trust
them
not
for
there
is
an
upstart
crow
beautified
with
our
feathers
that
with
his
tiger’s
heart
wrapped
in
a
player’s
hide
supposes
he
is
as
well
able
to
bombast
out
a
blank-verse
as
the
best
of
you
and
in
a
country

Oh
that
I
might
entreat
your
rare
wits
to
be
employed
in
more
profitable
courses
and
let
these
apes
imitate
your
past
excellence
and
never
more
acquaint
them
with
your
admired
inventions

I
know
the
best
husband
of
you
all
will
never
prove
an
usurer
and
the
kindest
of
them
all
will
never
prove
a
kind
nurse
yet
whilst
you
may
seek
your
better
masters
for
it
is
pity
men
of
such
rare
wits
should
be
subject
to
the
pleasures
of
such
rude
grooms

In
this
I
might
insert
two
more
that
both
have
write
against
these
buckram
gentlemen
but
let
their
own
work
serve
to
witness
against
their
own
wickedness
if
they
persevere
to
maintain
any
more
such
peasants

Delight
not
as
I
have
done
in
irreligious
oaths
for
from
the
blasphemers
house
a
curse
shall
not
depart

Despise
drunkenness
which
wastes
the
wit
and
makes
men
all
equal
unto
beasts

Fly
lust
as
the
deathsman
of
the
soul
and
defile
not
the
temple
of
the
Holy
Ghost

Abhor
those
epicures
whose
loose
life
has
made
religion
loathsome
to
your
ears
and
when
they
soothe
you
with
terms
of
mastership
remember
Robert
Greene
whom
they
have
often
so
flattered
perishes
now
for
want
of
comfort

Remember
gentlemen
your
lives
are
like
so
many
light
tapers
that
are
with
care
delivered
to
all
of
you
to
maintain
these
with
windpuft
wrath
may
be
extinguished
with
drunkenness
put
out
with
negligence
let
fall
for
man’s
time
of
itselfe
is
not
so
short
but
it
is
more
shortened
by
sin

The
fire
of
my
life
is
now
at
the
last
snuff
and
the
want
of
wherewith
to
sustain
it
there
is
no
substance
for
life
to
feed
on

Trust
not
then
I
beseech
you
left
to
such
weak
stays
for
they
are
as
changeable
in
mind
as
in
many
attires

Well
my
hand
is
tired
and
I
am
forced
to
leave
where
I
would
begin
for
a
whole
book
cannot
contain
their
wrongs
which
I
am
forced
to
knit
up
in
some
few
lines
of
words

The
remembrance
of
many
wrongs
offered
thee
and
thy
unreproved
virtues
add
greater
sorrow
to
my
miserable
state
than
I
can
utter
or
thou
conceive

Neither
is
it
lessened
by
consideration
of
thy
absence
(
though
shame
would
let
me
hardly
behold
thy
face
but
exceedingly
aggravated
for
that
I
cannot
(
as
I
ought
to
thy
own
self
reconcile
myself
that
thou
might
witness
my
inward
woe
at
this
instant
that
have
made
thee
a
woeful
wife
for
so
long
a
time

But
equal
heaven
has
denied
that
comfort
giving
at
my
last
need
like
succour
as
I
have
sought
all
my
life
being
in
this
extremity
as
void
of
help
as
thou
has
been
of
hope

Reason
would
that
after
so
long
waste
I
should
not
send
thee
a
child
to
bring
thee
greater
charge
but
consider
he
is
the
fruit
of
thy
womb
in
whose
face
regard
not
the
fathers
so
much
as
thy
own
perfection

He
is
yet
Greene
and
may
grow
straight
if
he
is
carefully
tended
otherwise
apt
enough
(
I
fear
me
to
follow
his
father’s
folly

That
I
have
offended
thee
highly
I
know
that
thou
can
forget
my
injuries
I
hardly
believe
yet
persuade
I
my
self
if
thou
saw
my
wretched
estate
thou
could
not
but
lament
it
nay
certainly
I
know
thou
would

All
my
wrongs
muster
themselves
about
me
every
evil
at
once
plagues
me

For
my
contempt
of
God
I
am
condemned
of
men
for
my
swearing
and
forswearing
no
man
will
believe
me
for
my
gluttony
I
suffer
hunger
for
my
drunkenness
thirst
for
my
adultery
ulcerous
sores

GOD
comfort
you
my
Lord
when
you
would
as
it
pleased
your
Lordship
to
comfort
my
daunted
spirits
which
were
so
changed
thereby
and
stirred
up
by
your
Lordship’s
so
honourable
most
kind
and
unlooked
for
visitation
as
turned
melancholy
into
a
sanguine

My
Lord
in
truth
I
am
weak

Heat
in
the
forepart
of
my
head
unfeignedly
with
shooting
pain
and
swimming
brain
makes
me
on
my
faith
to
fear
a
sudden
death
like
to
the
Earl
Dorset

Sure
I
am
that
I
sleep
little
eat
less
nor
drank
a
draught
of
ale
beer
or
wine
since
my
coming
to
Windsor
but
water
and
lemons
by
physicians
advice

But
in
truth
I
had
climbed
up
and
stood
from
your
Lordship's
coming
in
to
your
going
out
which
made
me
faint
and
sweat
truly

Thus
much
have
I
troubled
your
Lordship
because
I
would
not
willingly
deserve
to
be
thought
a
dissembler
or
hypocrit

Because
I
here
your
Lordship
meant
to
be
gone
early
in
the
morning
I
am
bowled
to
send
your
pale
thin
cheeks
a
comfortable
little
breakfast
against
the
contagion
of
this
time

God
bless
you
with
the
continuance
of
all
health
and
happiness
as
I
would
to
myself
unfeignedly

I
would
entreat
you
to
think
a
little
upon
the
solitary
passions
of
your
servant./
If
I
find
not
my
patience
to
be
from
you
six
weeks
to
grow
to
greater
strength
hereafter
I
must
give
over
my
profession

For
I
swear
might
I
dissemble
my
habit
I
had
rather
be
in
your
scullion
boys‘
place
than
where
I
am
for
so
should
I
be
a
creature
whereas
now
I
am
but
a
shadow
divided
from
mine
own
life
and
essence

I
am
like
an
old
priest
that
comes
to
church
to
read
a
chapter
and
has
left
his
spectacles
at
home
so
am
I
come
to
behold
the
practise
of
the
law
and
have
left
mine
eyes
of
my
mind
in
your
bosom

O
send
me
those
eyes
that
they
may
tell
me
how
little
you
remember
me
how
much
gladder
you
are
to
be
kindly
entreated
by
some
other
than
by
myself
and
how
sorry
you
are
that
my
return
shall
so
so
sic
soon
interrupt
your
liberty

Let
them
make
relation
of
your
slight
regard
of
my
earnest
affection
of
your
secret
smiles
at
my
folly
your
settled
resolution
to
feed
me
with
shows
and
make
a
fiddler's
bridge
of
my
heart
over
which
the
music
passes
to
others'
ears
but
itself
has
neither
sense
nor
share
in
it

Let
those
eyes
of
my
mind
which
I
left
with
you
come
and
make
report
to
me
of
some
thing
true
or
false
that
may
be
a
persuasion
to
me
that
it
is
in
vain
for
me
to
love
you
for
till
then
I
shall
never
leave
loving
over
much
which
will be
but
loathsome
to
you
and
thankless
troublesome
to
me
and
endless

But
o
sweet
trouble
that
has
within
these
weeks
assured
me
that
the
only
absence
is
grief
without
intermission
proceeds
from
my
imperfection
for
your
has
taken
order
to
the
contrary
has
neither
sent
letter
nor
message
given
any
demonstration
of
longing
for
me
which
had
been
the
only
fuel
to
maintain
the
passions
of
love
the
only
wind
that
would
fill
the
sails
of
those
thoughts
which
might
loose
themselves
in
an
ocean
of
sighs
tears
throbs
and
tempests
that
poor
lovers
endure

But
your
discretion
has
forborne
all
such
occasions
and
your
silence
has
pleaded
against
my
vanity
who
if
I
am
asked
why
do
you
love
her
so
much
I
cannot
say
so
much
for
myself

she
would
have
me
do
so

Honourable
Sir
I
know
there
be
private
causes
to
discourage
me
from
moving
you
herein
yet
seeing
the
highest
providence
has
placed
you
in
a
calling
most
proper
to
be
a
man
for
my
comfort
and
that
former
experience
had
taught
me
that
you
are
rather
inclined
to
do
good
then
to
look
always
to
private
interest
I
beseech
you
even
for
your
virtues
sake
perform
this
noble
office
for
me
as
to
join
with
the
rest
of
your
letters
of
the
Council
in
presenting
my
humblest
these
tedious
blots
from
her
feeble
hand
and
sad
sick
heart
that
is
stored
with
much
thankfulness
and
infinite
best
wishes
unto
you
who
will
ever
rest

most
beholding
poor
distressed

And
Mister
Secretary
even
as
you
desire
of
God
that
your
own
son
never
be
made
orphan
by
the
untimely
or
unnatural
death
of
his
dear
father
vouchsafe
a
relenting
to
the
not
urging
if
you
may
not
to
the
hindering
of
that
fatal
warrant
for
Execution

it

Of
myself
(
who
if
honesty
were
precious
were
worth
the
talking
of
let
me
say
a
little

The
commissioners
by
imprisoning
the
witnesses
and
excommunicating
all
us
have
implicitly
justified
our
marriage

Sir
George
will
as
I
hear
keep
her
till
I
send
for
her
and
let
her
remain
there
yet
his
good
nature
and
her
sorrow
will
work
something

I
have
liberty
to
ride
abroad
and
feel
not
much
of
an
imprisonment

For
my
return
to
my
Lord
and
Sir
George's
pacification
you
know
my
means
and
therefore
my
hopes

"
Of
Ostend
it
is
said
there
has
been
a
new
blow
given

If
the
Emperor
were
dead
before
you
went
perchance
he
is
buried
by
this
time

I
hope
somebody
else
has
had
the
ill
luck
to
tell
you
first
that
the
young
Bedford
is
dead

The
King
of
Spain

to
spend
this
summer
in
Italy

there
I
think
by
that
time
will
be
our
Lords
of
Pembroke
Willoughby

Worcester

The
Lord-Deputy
has
cut
off
some
of
Tyrrel’s
now
lately

no
great
number

I
send
this
letter
to
ask
the
way
to
Polesworth
if
I
hear
it
find
it
I
shall
cost
you
half
an

read
the
rest

I
hear
nothing
of
your
warrant
from
Mr.
Andrew
Lee

Take
my
love
and
honesty
into
the
good
opinion

recommend
my
poor
unworthy
thanks
and
service
to
your
good
lady

23rd
February
16012
from
my
chamber
at
Mr.
Haine’s
house
by
the
Savoy
(
for
this
language
your
subscriptions
use)

In
which
assuredly
(
whatsoever
else
may
fail
I
will
ever
endeavour
to
equal
you
esteeming
that
time
happiest
when
I
enjoyed
your
company
and
desiring
nothing
more
than
the
fruition
of
it
again
that
as
nature
has
made
us
nearest
in
our
love
together
so
accident
might
not
separate
us
from
living
together

Neither
do
I
account
it
the
least
part
of
my
present
comfort
that
though
I
am
deprived
of
your
happy
presence
yet
I
can
make
these
lines
deliver
this
true
message
that
I
will
ever
be
during
my
life
Your
most
kind
and
loving
sister
Elizabeth
To
my
most
dear
brother
the
Prince

Most
honourable
Lord
Although
I
cannot
but
know
your
Lordship
to
be
busied
with
far
greater
and
higher
affairs
than
to
have
leisure
to
descend
suddenly
on
an
estate
so
low
and
removed
as
mine
yet
since
the
cause
is
in
us
wholly
mistaken
(
at
least
misconstrued
and
that
every
noble
and
just
man
is
bound
to
defend
the
innocent
I
doubt
not
but
to
find
your
Lordship
full
of
that
wonted
virtue
and
favour
wherewith
you
have
ever
abounded
toward
the
truth

And
though
the
imprisonment
itself
can
not
but
grieve
me
(
in
respect
of
his
Majesty‘s
high
displeasure
from
whence
it
proceeds
yet
the
manner
of
it
afflicts
me
more
being
committed
hither
unexamined
nay
unheard
(
a
right
not
commonly
denied
to
the
greatest
offenders
and
I
made
a
guilty
man
long
before
I
am
one
or
ever
thought
to
be
God
I
call
to
testimony
what
my
thoughts
are
and
ever
have
been
of
his
Majesty
and
so
may
I
thrive
when
he
comes
to
be
my
judge
and
my
King‘s
as
they
are
most
sincere
And
I
appeal
to
posterity
that
will
hereafter
read
and
judge
my
writings
(
though
now
neglected
whether
it
be
possible
I
should
speak
of
his
Majesty
as
I
have
done
without
the
affection
of
a
most
zealous
and
good
subject

It
has
ever
been
my
destiny
to
be
misreported
and
condemned
on
the
first
tale
but
I
hope
there
is
an
ear
left
for
me
and
by
your
honour
I
hope
it
who
have
always
been
friend
to
justice
a
virtue
that
crowns
your
nobility

So
with
my
most
humble
prayer
of
your
pardon
and
all
advanced
wishes
for
your
honour
I
begin
to
know
my
duty
which
is
to
forbear
to
trouble
your
Lordship
till
my
languishing
estate
may
draw
free
breath
from
your
comfortable
word

a
(
the
word
irks
me
that
our
fortune
has
necessitated
us
to
so
despised
a
course
a
play
my
Lord
whereof
we
hope
there
is
no
man
can
justly
complain
that
has
the
virtue
to
think

favourably

himself

an
equal
ear
mary

with
prejudice
we
are

asinine
virtue

My
noble
Lord
they
deal
not
charitably

are
too
witty

utter
some
times
their

malicious
meanings

I
protest
to
your
honour

call
God
to
testimony
(
since
my
first
error
which
(
yet
is
punished
in
me
more
with
my
shame
than
it
was
then
with
my
bondage
I
have
so
attempred
my
style
that
I
have
given
no
cause
to
any
good
man
of
grace
and
if
to
any
ill
by
touching
at
any
general
vice
it
has
always
been
with
a
regard
and
sparing
of
particular
persons
I
may
be
otherwise
reported
but
if
all
that
are
accused
should
be
presently
guilty
there
are
few
men
would
stand
in
the
state
of
innocence

I
beseech
your
most
honourable
Lordship
suffer
not
other
men's
errors
or
faults
past
to
be
made
my
crimes
but
let
me
be
examined
both
by
all
my
works
past
and
this
present
and
not
trust
to
rumour
but
my
books

she
is
an
unjust
deliverer

of
great
and
small
actions

diligent

my
excuse

may
incur
the
suspicion

Benjamin
Ionson
Noble
Lord
I
have
so
confirmed
opinion
of
your
virtue
and
am
so
fortified
in
mine
own
innocence
as
I
dare
(
without
blushing
at
any
thing
save
your
trouble
put
my
fame
into
your
hands
which
I
prefer
to
my
life

The
cause
of
my
commitment
I
understand
is
his
Majesty’s
high
displeasure
conceived
against
me
for
which
I
am
most
inwardly
sorry
but
how
I
should
deserve
it
I
have
yet
I
thank
God
so
much
integrity
as
to
doubt

I
therefore
crave
of
your
Lordship
this
noble
benefit
rightly
to
inform
his
Majesty
that
I
never
in
thought
word
or
act
had
purpose
to
offend
or
grieve
him
but
with
all
my
powers
have
studied
to
show
my
self
most
loyal
and
zealous
to
his
whole
disseignes
that
in
primate
and
public
by
speech
and
writings
I
have
ever
professed
it
and
if
there
be
one
man
or
devil
to
be
produced
that
can
affirm
the
contrary
let
me
suffer
under
all
extremity
that
justice
nay
tyranny
can
inflict
I
speak
not
this
with
any
spirit
of
contumacy
for
I
know
there
is
no
subject
has
so
safe
an
innocence
but
may
rejoice
to
stand
justified
in
sight
of
his
Sovereign’s
mercy

to
which
we
must
humbly
submit
our
selves
our
lives
and
fortunes

it
be
not
a
sin
to
profane
your

prison
polluted
paper
I
would
entreat
some
little
of
your
aid

the
defence
of
my
innocence

is
as
clear
as
this
leaf
was

stained
it

half
committed

a
man
I
can
not

how
known

your

I
am
sure
known
to
me
to
honour
you

our
offence
a
play
so
mistaken
so
misconstrued
so
misapplied
as
I
do
wonder
whether
their
ignorance
or
impudence
be
most
who
are
our
adversaries

It
is
now
not
disputable
for
we
stand
on
new
bases
and
our
cause
so
unequally
carried
as
we
are
without
examining
without
hearing
or
without
any
proof
but
malicious
rumour
hurried
to
bondage
and
fetters
the
cause
we
understand
to
be
the
Kings
indignation
for
which
we
are
heartily
sorry
and
the
more
by
how
much
the
less
we
have
deserved
it

What
our
suit
is
the
worthy
employed
solicitor
and
equal
adorer
of
your
virtues
can
best
inform

me
not
to
solicit

call
you

a
time

such
need
were
no
less
a

a
main
encouragement

I
lay
here
on
my

more
backward

importune
you

as
it
is

no

any
indifferent
love

his

deny

with

engaged
himself

they

it
a

For
my

I
would
have
put
on

such

Your

everywhere

use
them
and
have
them

I
enjoy
them
at
London
and
leave
them
there
and
yet
find
them
at
Mitcham

Such
riddles
as
these
become
things
inexpressible
and
such
is
your
goodness

I
was
almost
sorry
to
find
your
servant
here
this
day
because
I
was
loth
to
have
any
witness
of
my
not
coming
home
last
night
and
indeed
of
my
coming
this
morning

But
my
not
coming
was
excusable
because
earnest
business
detained
me
and
my
coming
this
day
is
by
the
example
of
your
St.

rose
early

yours

I

how
much
I
owed
you
for
them
how
good
a
mother
how
fertile
and
abundant
the
understanding
is
if
she
have
a
good
father
and
how
well
friendship
performs
that
office

For
that
which
is
denied
in
other
generations
is
done
in
this

here
is
superfetation

If

indifferent

entreat
me
to
have
mercy
upon
you

spare
you

you

our

took
the

that
it
was
the
best
way
to
despatch
the
French
Prince
back
again
quickly
to
receive
him
solemnly
ceremoniously

expensively
when
he
hoped
a
domestic
and
durable
entertainment

never
meant

excel
you

thought
I
might

he
may
cast
up
a
greater
sum

they

these
wishes
therefore
which
you
won

were

be

of
the

as
in
some

to
some

counsels
become

have
with
my
brother
about
a
cloak
but
shall
have
it
and
I
will
set
it
on
making
presently

I
will
send
by
the
next
messenger
what
D.
Lake
has
done

Thus
in
haste
I
could
wish
I
might
carry
Mr.
Pembrug
Cloakebagge
so
that
I
might
but
come
by
the
door
and
see
you

I
have
spoken
to
Sir
Henry
Williams
for
Morgan
but
he
is
gone
on
a
sudden

I
have
spoken
to
Wotton
but
he
comes
not
down
I
fear
tell
Mr.
Wallwyn
I
rely
on
him
to
go
to
the
judge
if
need
be

let
Thom
Gwillim
return
my
recognisances
and
examinations
taken
before
me
to
the
judge
carefully

MY
KIND
DOG
Your
letter
has
been
acceptable
to
me
I
rest
already
assured
of
your
carefulness

You
may
tell
your
Master
that
the
King
of
Denmark
has
sent
me
twelve
faire
mares
and
as
the
bringer
of
them
assures
me
all
great
with
files
which
I
intend
to
put
into
Byfield
Park
where
being
the
other
day
a
hunting
I
could
find
but
very
few
dear
but
great
store
of
other
cattle
as
I
shall
tell
your
Master
myself
when
I
see
him

I
hope
to
meet
you
all
at
Woodstock
at
the
time
appointed
till
when
I
wish
you
all
happiness
and
contentment

ANNA
R.
I
thank
you
for
your
pains
taken
in
remembering
the
King
for
the
paling
of
my
park

I
will
do
you
any
service
I
can

To
Sir
George
Villiers

To
my
most
loving
wife
Mrs.
Ben
Hoskins

Good
sweetheart
I
was
not
very
well
upon
my
travel

I
received
it
as
from
a
lord
that
I
had
just
cause
to
honour
and
when
I
had
done
with
my
horse
I
would
go
in
and
read
it
and
repair
to
my
lord
or
otherwise
accomplish
what
he
should
expect
of
me
she
would
had
the
matter
put
to
friends
I
told
I
knew
her
husband's
disposition
the
matter
betwixt
him
and
me
was
known
in
the
best
courts
in
England
and
when
I
had
satisfied
my
lord
president
then
let
her
husband
use
his
discretion

She
would
had
me
read
the
letter
in
her
presence

I
told
her
my
lord
had
other
matters
heretofore
which
he
communicated
with
me
it
may
be
some
such
are
in
the
letter
also
which
concern
her
not
nor
her
husband
so
she
departed
and
I
turned
my
back
and
read
the
letter

I
had
a
shoulder
and
ambles
the
ambles
I
send
you
none
here
can
dress
them
the
shoulder
I
keep
for
Mr.
Delehay‘s
supper
if
he
comes

I
have
some
pills
from
filly
who
was
here
yesterday
when
I
was
at
Goodrich

I
am
promised
half
a
buck
against
Sunday
which
I
will
keep
in
stead
of
our
marriage
day
for
which
I
am
to
thank
God
above
all
his
worldly
blessings
and
therefore
do
more
rejoice
in
this
title
than
any
mortal
dignity

Your
true
loving
husband
John
Hoskyns

Sweetheart
I
have
agreed
to
sell
the
parsonage
for
830
pounds
and
10
angels
for
you
I
could
get
no
more
possibly
for
parsonages
are
at
12
years
purchase
and
this
price
comes
to
above
13
years
purchase

Sir
James

his
money

married
to
a
needy
fellow
her
husband
haunts
me
by
himself
and
others
every
day
for
80
pounds

So
does
one
king
likewise
for
50
pounds
that
I
owe
for
most
part
of
the
money
for
Dydley

And
the
tailor
to
whom
I
owe
72
pounds
for
Rawlinges
and
some
10
pounds
for
myself
if

Bacon
calls
for
10
pounds
that
I
undertook
8
years
since
for
Colipep
part
of
the
price
of
my
chamber

I
must
be
out
of
debt
here
or
else
I
may
give
over
my
practise
which
I
hope
will be
in
London
better
than
200
pounds
a
year
and
I
would
be
loth
it
should
go
to
pay
use
and
the
principal
undischarged

this
day
my
gaignes
this
term
comes
to
23
pounds
I
hope
the
term
will
make
it
above
30
pounds

I
have
received
of
cattle
three
pound
for
rent
of
Churchehill
and
Bemwell
lands

I
received
no
other
rent
of
Somersetshire
nor
the
10
pounds
yet
of
Mr.
Whitson
though
he
every
day
he
says
he
will
send
it

My
rent
to
Tomchester
this
year
came
to
25
pounds
which
was
all
the
rent
of
Dover
Court
my
lease
of
Titley
expires
at
Michaelmas
next
therefore
I
must
sue
to
renew
it
as
I
have
written

So
that
now
I
have
paid
the
seven
pound
10
shillings
to
the
King
for
Dover
Court
out
of
my
poor
gains

I
account
I
must
pay
in
debts
above
300
pounds
here
besides
I
must
lay
out
above
20
pounds
for
John
Delehay
to
get
the
cause
heard
the
next
term
which
he
promises
to
allow
or
pay
me
by
his
letter
written
with
Morgan
Delehay‘s
hand

If
I
could
so
compass
it
that
I
owed
nothing
but
to
Thomas
Webb
and
John
Delehay
I
would
think
myself
happy
for
Clement
expects
his
money
and
if
Doctor
Bradshaw
or
his
wife
will
have
any
money
paid
here
send
me
word

I
think
I
must
send
down
one
of
my
men
to
take
a
fine
of
you
for
it
must
be
sent
up
and
the
money
received
before
I
can
come
down

the
commission
shall be
directed
to
my
lord
Bishop
to
whom
I
will
undertake
to
make
you
what
estate
you
will
in
Dydley
and
Bernithen

I
have
received
all
this
term
but
20
pounds
in
gold
which
I
send
you
by
this

Send

I
may
finish

Good
Mr.
Hinchlow
I
am
upon
the
sudden
put
to
great
extremity
in
bailing
my
man
committed
to
Newgate
upon
taking
a
possession
for
me
and
I
took
less
money
of
my
kinsman
a
lawyer
that
was
with
me
than
served
my
turn

I
am
therefore
to
beseech
you
to
spare
me
twenty
which
will
do
me
so
great
pleasure
that
you
shall
find
me
thankful
and
performing
more
than
ever
I
promised
or
am
tied
to
so
bold
upon
so
great
an
occasion
to
trouble
you
I
crave
your
favourable
interpretation
and
rest
ever
at
your
command

Mr.

this
money

I
have
not
only
laboured
my
own
play
which
shall
be
ready
before
they
come
over
but
given
Cyrill
Tourneur
an
act
of
the
arrangement
of
London
to
write
that
we
may
have
that
likewise
ready
for
them

I
wish
you
had
spoken
with
them
to
know
their
resolution
for
they
depend
upon
your
purpose

I
have
sent
you
2
sheets
more
fair
written
upon
my
faith
sir
they
shall
not
stay
one
hour
for
me
therefore
I
beseech
you
as
hitherto
so
you
would
now
spare
me
40
s.
which
stands
me
upon
to
send
over
to
my
counsel
in
a
matter
concerns
my
whole
estate
and
where
I
deal
otherwise
than
to
your
content
may
I
and
mine
want
friendship
in
distress

So
relying
on
your
favour
which
shall
never
reap
loss

me

Sir
I
expected
you
on
Monday

perceive
you
misdoubt
my
readiness
sir
I
would
not
be
hired
to
break
my
faith
with
you

I
desired
and
then
when
I
read
next

I
will
take
the
40
shillings
that
remains
and

not
you

20

will

me
have
perusal
of
any
other
book
of
yours

Mr.
Hinchlow
my
troubles
drawing
to
some
end
have
forced
me
to
be
troublesome
to
you
beyond
my
purpose
because
I
would
be
free
at
any
rate

Some
papers
I
have
sent
you
though
not
so
fair
written
all
as
I
could
wish

I
will
now
wholly
intend
to
finish
my
promise
which
though
it
come
not
within
compass
of
this
term
shall
come
upon
the
neck
of
this
new
play
they
are
now
studying
my
request
is
the
10
might
be
made
up
whereof
I
have
had
9
if
you
please
to
appoint
any
hour
to
read
to
Mr.
Allin
I
will
not
fail
nor
after
this
day
loose
any
time
till
it
be
concluded

Mr.
Hinchlow
your
tried
courtesy
has
so
far
engaged
me
that
howsoever
this
term
has
much
hindered
my
business
you
shall
see
one
Tuesday
night
I
have
not
been
idle

I
thank
God
most
of
my
troubles
are
ended
upon
clearing
whereof
I
have
taken
home
my
wife
again
so
that
I
will
now
after
Monday
intend
your
business
carefully
that
the
company
shall
acknowledge
themselves
bound
to
you
I
doubt
not

One
Tuesday
night
if
you
will
appoint
I
will
meet
you
and
Mr.
Allin
and
read
some
for
I
am
unwilling
to
read
to
the
general
company
till
all
be
finished
which
upon
my
credit
shall
be
to
play
it
this
next
term
with
the
first

Sir
my
occasions
of
expense
have
been
so
great
and
so
many
I
am
ashamed
to
think
how
much
I
am
forced
to
press
you
wherein
I
pray
let
me
find
your
favourablest
construction
and
add
one
20
shillings
more
to
the
money
I
have
received
which
makes
11
and
you
shall
one
Tuesday
see
I
will
deserve
to
my
best
ability
your
love
which
I
value
more
in
it
self
than
the
best
companies
in
the
town

So
myself
and
labours
resting
at

would
be
my

for
another

take
10

before
I
wrote
unto
you
which
upon
hopes
of
your

I
forsook

must
now
if
you

I
had
ended
return

do
me
one
courtesy
more

Thursday
when
we

deny
not

if
you
find
me
not

again
very
shortly
when
I
have
spoken
to
my
son
when
I
will
truly
answer
your
letter
from
point
to
point

I
pray
you
recommend
my
love
to
the
Lady
Cornwallis
whose
love
I
desire
to
continue
though
she
will
not
yield
it
me
in
that
sort
I
desire

And
thus
in
haste
fare
well

God
has
the
disposing
of
all
things
and
to
Him
I
commit
this
and
all
other

Your
assured
ANNE
BACON

To
my
assured
friend
Mister
Parr

I
have
received
your
letters
but
I
have
not
leisure
neither
to
read
them
as
I
should
nor
to
write
an
answer
as
I
would
my
house
being
full
of
strangers
but
if
God
will
I
will
write
shortly

My
son
Nathaniel
as
I
think
is
at
London
if
he
be
not
gone
beyond
the
seas
which
he
did
purpose
as
I
perceived
by
his
letters
the
last
week

Soon
his
distance
will
be
very
great
so
as
we
are
content
to
let
him
travel
for
his
recreation

You
shall
hear
from
me
shortly
till
then
fare
well

By
a
dim
candle
and
old
eyes
going
to
bed

Your
assured
friend
ANNE
BACON

1613

To
my
very
loving
friend
Mister
Parr
the
Minister
of
God's
word
in
Palgrave

I
DO
perceive
that
the
old
proverb
be
not
always
true
for
I
do
find
that
the
absence
of
my
Nathaniel
does
breed
in
me
the
more
continual
remembrance
of
him
and
I
cannot
think
of
him
but
I
must
do
the
like
of
your
Ladyship
who
I
know
is
lodged
in
the
principal
part
of
his
heart

But
how
you
stand
affected
unto
him
I
know
not
otherwise
than
his
resolution
to
travel
makes
me
to
suspect
it

But
howsoever
I
do
and
ever
shall
love
you
unfeignedly
and
most
dearly
in
the
Lord
and
am
and
shall
be
always
ready
to
do
any
kindness
or
service
that
one
Christian
friend
may
perform
unto
another

And
I
wish
from
my
heart
that
I
were
able
to
obtain
you
to
my
self
as
my
own
if
I
might
be
so
happy

But
what
I
cannot
have
by
alliance
you
shall
have
by
Christian
band

And
I
wish
my
son’s
estate
were
answerable
to
your
content

In
short
I
hope
to
enjoy
you
as
I
would
for
a
truer
husband
and
one
that
loved
you
better
shall
you
never
have

But
I
recommend
him
and
you
both
unto
the
disposing
of
Almighty
God
who
sits
in
the
heavens
and
orders
all things
in
this
wicked
world
for
the
good
of
his
children
and
for
the
destruction
of
his
enemies
howsoever
for
a
time
they
seem
to
flourish

To
my
very
noble
good
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis
at
Missis
Cooke
her
house
near
to
the
Earl
of
Northampton's
house
by
Charing
Cross

MADAM
I
CANNOT
forbear
to
signify
unto
you
how
welcome
my
son
Nathaniel
with
your
favour
is
unto
me
for
without
it
I
think
I
should
not
have
seen
him
a
great
while

And
now
Madam
as
you
shall
find
us
in
love
ready
to
perform
all
things
as
we
have
spoken
unto
you
so
shall
I
not
cease
to
pray
unto
the
Lord
Almighty
for
the
increase
of
faithful
love
between
you
with
all
spiritual
graces
and
happiness
in
this
life
and
in
the
life
to
come
endless
felicity
to
you
and
yours
in
the
presence
of
the
Blessed
Trinity
where
is
fullness
of
joy
and
at
whose
right
hand
are
unspeakable
pleasures
for
evermore

And
if
it
shall
please
you
to
take
Culford
in
your
return
from
London
you
shall
be
most
entirely
welcome
and
I
shall
much
rejoice
in
it
and
Nathaniel
will
meet
you
on
the
way
to
direct
you
thither

And
thus
good
Lady
with
more
true
love
in
heart
than
I
can
express
in
words
I
leave
you
to
the
blessed
direction
of
Almighty
God
and
do
rest
your
ever
loving
friend
ANNE
BACON

1613-14

To
my
dearly
beloved
friend
the
Lady
Jane
Cornwallis
give
this
at
London

Your
delay
in
coming
down
has
caused
you
once
again
to
be
troubled
with
my
dear
Nathaniel
at
London

My
husband
recommends
him
very
kindly
unto
you
and
we
both
do
very
willingly
give
unto
you
the
jewel
of
our
dear
son

God
bless
you
together
with
abundance
of
all
felicity
in
this
life
and
in
the
life
to
come
the
presence
of
the
Blessed
Trinity
a
greater
happiness
cannot
be
to
any

Dear
Lady
the
blessed
God
be
with
you
for
ever

Yours
ANNE

my
most
dearly
beloved
the
Lady

this
at
at
London

DEAR
CORNWALLIS
THE
KING
of
Denmark's
unexpected
coming
has
constrained
me
to
defer
my
setting
forward
towards
Rutland
from
the
8th
of
August
to
the
tenth
which
is
Wednesday
coming seven nights
and
so
it
will
be
the
11th
before
I
shall
be
at
Huntingdon
where
I
promise
myself
the
contentment
of
meeting
you
whereof
to
have
a
confirmation
and
that
you
may
not
be
ignorant
of
this
alteration
I
send
this
bearer
whom
let
me
entreat
you
to
dispatch
as
soon
as
you
may
and
suffer
not
any
thing
less
than
necessity
to
change
your
purpose
and
Mister
Bacon's
to
take
this
journey
for
her
sake
that
will
ever
be
to
you
both
a
most
assured
and
affectionate
friend
Lady
BEDFORD
My
mistress
commanded
me
not
to
forget
her
kindest
recommendations
to
you

Bedford
House
in
haste
this
Saturday
morning
30th
July
1614

Now
I
thank
God
I
can
say
that
out
of
a
very
great
and
almost
hopeless
danger
my
Lord
of
Bedford
has
recovered
so
much
health
and
strength
as
we
are
out
of
all
fear
of
him
and
do
conceive
that
the
violent
fever
he
has
had
has
done
him
some
good
for
his
palsy
his
speech
being
better
than
it
was
before
he
fell
sick
though
his
lameness
be
nothing
amended

His
present
state
sets
me
at
liberty
to
follow
my
term
businesses
which
daily
are
multiplied
upon
me
and
make
me
heavily
feel
the
burden
of
a
broken
estate
yet
do
I
not
doubt
but
by
the
assistance
of
Almighty
God
I
shall
ere
long
overcome
all
those
difficulties
which
at
the
present
contest
with
me

Though
yesterday
Sir
John
Harington
has
begun
a
course
in
the
Chansery
against
my
mother
but
indeed
most
concerning
me
whereby
he
will
get
nothing
but
lost
labour
nor
will
it
cost
me
more
than
some
few
lawyers'
fees
and
a
little
trouble
which
I
am
born
to
and
therefore
embrace
it
as
part
of
my
portion

I
extremely
desire
to
hear
whether
your
ill
health
this
summer
have
had
so
happy
an
issue
as
I
hoped
it
would
which
let
me
entreat
you
by
this
bearer
I
may
and
whether
you
have
any
purpose
to
see
London
this
winter
or
no
because
if
you
have
not
I
will
then
send
to
you
again
before
the
end
of
the
term

Your
cousin
Killegrew
is
gone
to
see
your
neighbour
for
a
while
nothing
altered

My
Lady
Uvedale
is
become
the
fond
mother
of
a
son

My
Lady
Marquis
of
Winchester
is
dead
and
our
noble
friend
my
Lord
Mounteagle
very
ill
of
a
swelling
in
his
throat

John
Elviston
died
on
Tuesday
last
to
the
great
grief
of
all
good
dancers

Bedford
House
this
27th
of
October
1614

To
my
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis
at
Broome

Bedford
House
this
of
December
1615

DEAR
CORNWALLIS
BECAUSE
your
woman
went
so
suddenly
out
of
the
town
as
my
letters
failed
coming
time
enough
to
go
by
her
I
send
this
bearer
by
whose
journey
I
shall
not
only
have
the
means
to
bring
myself
to
your
remembrance
where
I
desire
to
live
as
your
most
affectionate
friend
but
the
contentment
to
hear
how
you
and
yours
do

If
I
might
also
by
him
understand
that
Mister
Bacon
and
you
would
shortly
be
in
town
it
would
be
very
welcome
news
to
me
that
am
like
to
be
a
Londoner
the
most
of
this
winter
to
air
my
house
at
Twickenham
against
the
spring

I
am
sure
the
businesses
now
afoot
here
fly
over
all
the
kingdom
and
therefore
cannot
be
unknown
to
you
yet
Sir
Thomas
Monson's
being
sent
this
morning
to
the
Tower
perhaps
will
not
be
so
soon
with
you
by
any
other
hand
as
by
this
letter
therefore
it
tells
you
of
that
and
that
the
change
of
his
prison
is
a
sign
there
is
more
to
be
laid
to
his
charge
than
what
concerns
Overbury's
death
only

My
Lady
of
Somerset
is
not
yet
brought
to
bed
but
this
is
her
last
day
of
reckoning

Where
and
when
this
tragedy
will
end
I
think
God
only
knows
to
whom
with
my
best
devotion
I
recommend
you
and
beg
of
you
that
no
omission
of
ceremonies
may
make
you
think
me
the
less
Your
faithful
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

Now
having
that
to
allege
for
myself
I
will
tell
you
that
I
cannot
so
easily
forget
the
many
proofs
I
have
had
of
your
affection
as
for
the
omission
of
any
ceremony
to
suspect
it

I
should
have
been
extreme
sorry
to
hear
of
your
children
not
being
well
if
withal
I
had
not
heard
so
good
news
of
their
amendment
whose
health
I
will
heartily
pray
may
so
fast
increase
as
I
may
see
both
you
and
them
shortly
here
which
I
know
cannot
be
but
that
I
shall
have
Mister
Bacon's
company
too
whose
good
opinion
and
love
I
shall
ever
declare
my
readiness
to
observe
whensoever
I
shall
be
so
happy
as
to
know
any
occasion
whereby
I
may
witness
what
I
am
to
him
for
his
own
worth
and
your
sake
whose
Most
faithful
and
affectionate
friend
I
am
LADY
BEDFORD
White
Hall
in
haste
this
Good Friday
at
12
o'clock
1616

My
Lady
of
Roxbrough
is
so
near
her
time
as
she
is
not
able
to
wait
which
ties
me
to
a
very
strict
attendance

Her
son
is
dead

My
Lady
of
Somerset
is
sent
to
the
Tower
and
will
be
very
shortly
arranged

The
Queen's
leg
is
whole
to
prevent
a
relapse
as
soon
as
the
King
is
gone
she
returns
to
Greenwich
and
enters
into
a
diet
this
spring

This
is
all
the
news
I
can
write
you

To
my
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

DEAR
MADAM
because
I
put
you
by
such
a
messenger
to
a
needless
trouble
to
read
these
lines
they
shall
only
beseech
you
to
take
from
him
all
the
assurance
of
my
love
and
desire
to
manifest
it
that
an
honest
heart
can
profess
till
I
have
the
happiness
to
see
you
myself
which
I
hope
God
will
not
deny
me
before
your
time
of
deliverance
though
I
am
not
able
to
set
a
certain
day
when
by
reason
of
my
building
and
some
business
I
have
with
the
dilatory
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer

So
soon
it
cannot
be
as
I
wish
that
long
extremely
to
tell
you
how
unalterably
I
am
Your
most
affectionate
friend
to
serve
you
LADY
BEDFORD

From
the
More
this
Wednesday
morning
in
haste

To
my
noble
and
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

DEAR
CORNWALLIS
IF
your
lines
are
ever
exceedingly
welcome
to
me
both
because
they
come
from
you
and
that
they
bring
with
them
the
assurance
of
the
continuance
of
your
affection
to
me
which
I
infinitely
prize
and
will
never
live
not
to
deserve
with
the
best
proofs
I
can
ever
give
you
of
mine
which
I
must
acknowledge
but
a
due
debt
to
you
as
is
the
visit
I
owe
you
at
your
own
house
which
that
I
have
not
according
to
my
promise
performed
there
has
been
no
fault
in
my
will
nor
other
hindrance
than
His
that
disposes
of
His
at
His
not
our
pleasure
and
as
I
formerly
wrote
to
you
made
my
health
such
all
the
last
summer
and
till
it
was
within
this
very
few
weeks
as
I
was
forced
to
settle
here
and
break
all
my
purposes
to
recover
my
self
out
of
a
very
ill
state
of
body
which
I
thank
God
I
have
now
so
done
as
I
hope
I
shall
be
as
well
able
to
travel
again
as
ever
and
if
I
be
so
I
will
if
beyond
my
power
to
help
I
be
not
again
prevented
see
you
at
Broome
before
my
going
into
Germany
whether
my
duty
to
my
mother
and
her
Highness
will
carry
me
this
spring
if
I
be
forced
as
I
think
I
shall
to
use
the
help
of
the
spa
for
the
confirmation
of
my
health
and
prevention
of
some
infirmities
I
have
of
late
years
been
subject
to
for
which
Mayerne
counsels
me
to
go
thither
which
I
shall
do
with
much
the
more
willingness
that
I
may
wait
by
that
occasion
on
my
mother
who
crossed
the
sea
thitherward
on
Thursday
last
and
I
hope
landed
well
that
night
at
Calais
though
I
have
not
yet
heard
so
much

I
have
not
forgotten
to
put
the
Queen
in
mind
of
her
promise
to
you
but
in
that
as
all
others
she
is
slow
in
performance
I
will
not
be
so
in
soliciting
her
till
you
have
your
desire
in
that
as
I
wish
it
you
in
all
else
with
as
much
unfeignedness
as
I
do
any
good
to
Your
most
affectionate
most
faithful
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

Do
me
the
favour
to
recommend
me
affectionately
to
Mister
Bacon

Bedford
House
where
I
am
stayed
in
expectation
of
the
Queen's
daily
remove
to
White
Hall
which
has
been
hindered
by
pain
in
her
foot
this
Sunday
morning
in
haste
1616

But
till
very
lately
I
was
not
assured
whether
I
should
have
gotten
leave
to
go
or
no
and
when
I
did
obtain
it
it
was
with
this
condition
that
I
should
not
invite
others
to
the
like
journey
which
I
do
so
punctually
observe
as
I
take
none
either
man
or
woman
with
me
but
my
own
servants
so
as
you
see
I
have
not
been
left
to
my
own
liberty
in
this
which
if
I
had
be
assured
I
should
have
entreated
both
you
and
Mister
Bacon
to
have
seen
the
Hage
with
me
as
those
of
whose
willingness
to
do
me
all
honour
I
am
most
confident
and
whose
companies
would
have
been
of
extreme
contentment
to
me

If
Mister
Bacon
passes
this
way
this
summer
I
wish
it
may
be
while
I
am
there
whether
if
God
give
me
health
I
intend
to
set
forward
from
hence
on
Tuesday
or
Wednesday
coming seven nights
and
to
stay
there
till
towards
the
20th
of
August
before
the
end
of
which
month
I
must
if
I
live
of
necessity
be
in
England
from
whence
though
there
be
little
odds
between
crossing
the
Thames
and
sea
I
part
not
without
so
settling
my
estate
as
whatsoever
becomes
of
me
every
one
shall
be
sure
of
their
own
and
you
not
be
prejudiced
by
your
kindness
to
me
to
whose
days
and
comforts
I
beseech
God
Almighty
to
add
many
and
to
give
me
means
to
express
how
affectionately
I
am
Your
most
faithful
and
thankful
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

I
will
not
fail
to
obey
you
to
the
Queen
of
Bohemia
nor
to
make
such
mention
of
you
as
become
my
love
and
knowledge
of
you

Harington
House
this
12th
of
July
1616

To
my
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

DEAR
MADAM
IT
troubled
me
much
that
you
should
think
me
so
negligent
as
not
to
have
written
to
you
again
upon
so
many
summons
as
it
seems
the
messenger
of
your
last
says
he
gave
me
but
in
my
excuse
I
must
first
say
the
letter
was
left
here
in
my
absence
and
certainly
so
has
his
callings
been
for
an
answer
if
at
all
for
I
have
examined
all
my
servants
to
whom
I
thought
it
likely
he
might
have
addressed
himself
and
neither
I
nor
they
can
remember
any
such
matter

Yet
perhaps
the
fault
has
not
been
his
neither
so
he
may
well
have
been
often
here
and
missed
me
for
some
little
building
I
have
in
hand
at
the
More
or
other
businesses
there
against
our
going
thither
this
summer
has
for
these
many
weeks
carried
me
often
from
home

Sure
I
am
neither
want
of
affection
or
desire
to
make
all
demonstrations
thereof
has
kept
my
letters
from
you
which
I
desire
you
will
believe
and
that
the
long
deferring
of
my
promise
to
visit
you
has
been
enforced
by
those
occasions
I
could
not
avoid
but
this
summer
I
hope
to
find
a
time
more
freely
mine
to
dispose
of
though
I
cannot
yet
name
any
being
to
attend
a
bargain
I
am
making
with
my
Lord
of
Buckingham's
officers
for
the
free
farm
of
Combe
which
will
carry
me
sooner
or
later
thither
as
we
conclude
or
break
but
I
will
first
enjoin
you
to
give
me
your
word
that
you
shall
not
make
my
coming
either
a
trouble
or
a
charge
for
you

My
Lord
Mounteagle
and
my
Lord
Chandos
are
very
shortly
going
to
the
spa
though
not
together
for
my
Lord
Mounteagle
is
grown
so
in
love
with
a
plentiful
fortune
and
a
private
enjoying
thereof
as
he
shuns
all
other
conversation

When
they
are
gone
there
will
scarce
be
a
gentleman
to
be
seen
about
this
town
whence
I
shall
not
stir
till
after
Midsummer
term

Out
of
Scotland
I
hear
no
news
but
that
the
English
of
quality
are
very
kindly
and
royally
entertained
by
the
nobility
but
the
meaner
sort
not
so
well
used
by
the
common
people
which
troubles
the
King
extremely
who
entertains
all
the
noblemen
went
with
him
not
as
servants
but
guests

This
is
all
his
journey
has
yet
brought
forth

By
the
next
you
can
send
to
London
by
let
me
know
when
you
look
you
that
I
may
not
appoint
to
come
to
you
at
an
unseasonable
time
and
I
beseech
you
be
more
confident
in
my
love
to
you
than
to
suspect
the
declination
thereof
upon
the
omission
of
any
ceremony
which
I
confess
I
am
often
guilty
of
towards
my
friends
though
never
willingly
of
any
such
neglect
as
may
give
them
a
just
cause
to
suspect
me
which
you
shall
never
have
but
all
the
proofs
in
my
power
that
I
am
as
much
as
you
can
wish
or
is
in
me
to
be
to
any
Your
most
faithful
and
affectionate
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

I
am
very
glad
to
hear
by
Missis
Kendrick
that
your
children
are
so
well

He
that
has
given
them
you
give
you
with
them
all
the
comforts
children
can
be
to
a
mother

Let
my
best
wishes
be
remembered
to
Mister
Bacon
as
I
make
them
for
him
and
give
me
leave
to
entreat
you
to
do
me
the
favour
to
let
some
servant
of
yours
carry
the
ten
pieces
I
have
delivered
this
bearer
to
Norwich
whence
I
have
had
two
letters
lately
from
the
fine
Mister
Russell
who
it
seems
the
fair
Queen
has
forsaken
for
he
writes
me
word
he
is
there
prisoner
in
the
undersheriff's
house
in
great
necessity
and
it
were
a
great
pity
so
complete
a
fool
should
starve
yet
I
am
loath
to
send
on
purpose
so
far
to
his
worship

DEAR
MADAM
—
I
have
nothing
to
accuse
you
of
though
you
cannot
but
condemn
me
as
a
promise
breaker
and
so
unmannerly
a
one
as
not
so
much
as
to
have
excused
myself
to
you
but
I
must
truly
protest
that
every
week
since
my
coming
out
of
Warwickshire
I
have
been
setting
a
day
to
come
to
you

From
thence
I
was
forced
to
follow
the
King
by
his
commandment
for
the
settling
of
a
business
I
have
long
had
in
hand
for
his
service
and
my
profit
and
so
could
not
get
the
liberty
of
2
or
3
days
to
go
into
Rutland
nor
since
my
coming
to
this
town
to
leave
it
so
many
days
as
would
have
brought
me
to
you
and
back
again
which
I
protest
I
have
as
much
desired
as
I
now
do
any
thing
and
resolve
if
you
come
up
this
winter
which
I
am
put
in
some
hopes
you
will
to
let
you
see
neither
winter
weather
nor
ways
can
fright
me
from
performing
before
Christmas
what
I
could
not
in
the
summer
though
I
should
be
extreme
glad
to
hear
we
should
meet
in
this
good
town
because
then
I
should
hope
to
be
much
the
longer
in
your
company
and
to
have
your
advice
and
Mister
Bacon's
in
my
works
at
the
More
where
I
have
been
a
patcher
this
summer
and
I
am
still
adding
some
trifles
of
pleasure
to
that
place
I
am
so
much
in
love
with
as
if
I
were
so
fond
of
any
man
I
were
in
hard
case

The
last
business
of
this
letter
is
to
beg
of
you
the
knowledge
how
you
and
yours
do
and
the
favour
I
may
be
affectionately
remembered
to
Mister
Bacon
and
ever
by
you
as
in
all
essential
things
I
will
be
found
the
truest
of
your
friends
LADY
BEDFORD

The
Queen
has
been
very
ill
of
late
but
is
now
well
again

The
noble
Lady
Roxbrough
is
in
Scotland
which
makes
me
perfectly
hate
the
court

Bedford
House
this
22nd
of
October
1617

To
my
very
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

DEAR
MADAM
IT
would
have
eased
me
of
a
great
deal
of
care
if
I
might
by
your
servant
have
heard
that
you
had
recovered
better
health
which
good
news
since
I
cannot
yet
receive
I
will
content
myself
with
this
hope
that
this
sickness
will
in
the
end
pay
you
much
comfort
for
the
pain
and
trouble
it
puts
you
to
and
so
make
me
amends
that
am
by
it
denied
your
company
which
I
so
much
desired
as
I
also
did
Mister
Bacon's
but
not
with
the
least
wish
to
deprive
you
in
this
state
of
your
greatest
comfort

You
have
sent
me
a
present
I
so
much
esteem
as
I
know
not
how
to
find
you
sufficient
thanks
for
it
and
can
only
acknowledge
it
to
be
the
finest
I
ever
saw
of
this
kind

To
my
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

DEAR
MADAM
I
THINK
the
time
too
long
since
I
heard
from
you
and
cannot
longer
rest
doubtful
how
you
and
yours
do
which
makes
me
send
this
messenger
by
whom
I
also
desire
to
understand
whether
you
intend
to
come
to
London
this
spring
as
I
was
told
which
I
should
be
extreme
glad
of
because
I
should
the
oftener
and
longer
have
your
company
but
if
you
do
not
I
have
now
so
settled
those
letters
of
my
businesses
have
hitherto
hindered
the
performance
of
my
promise
to
visit
you
as
I
can
now
if
God
Almighty
continue
my
health
make
good
my
word
whensoever
you
will
after
St.
George's
day
when
the
ways
will
be
fairer
and
the
weather
better
for
a
journey
by
which
I
promise
myself
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
in
surveying
your
good
housewifery
sooner
I
could
and
would
come
to
you
if
you
would
have
it
so
but
that
some
occasions
of
my
own
and
my
friends
make
me
not
a
free
woman
till
the
King
goes
to
Newmarket
or
Theatford
which
will
not
be
before
that
time

Till
then
if
there
be
any
thing
here
wherein
I
may
serve
you
let
me
know
it
and
if
I
do
it
not
with
as
much
care
and
affection
as
possible
for
a
faithful
friend
never
believe
again
that
I
have
any
truth
in
me
or
am
worthy
to
bear
the
title
of
your
most
unfeignedly
loving
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

I
had
almost
forgotten
an
earnest
request
I
am
to
make
by
you
to
Mister
Bacon
but
that
a
trick
my
Lord
of
Arundel
put
upon
me
yesterday
to
the
cusning
me
of
some
pictures
promised
me
put
me
in
mind
of
it

I
was
told
the
last
night
that
your
father-in-law
was
like
to
die
and
that
he
had
some
pieces
of
painting
of
Holbein's
which
I
am
sure
as
soon
as
Arundel
hears
he
will
try
all
means
to
get
but
I
beseech
you
entreat
Mister
Bacon
if
they
will
be
parted
with
to
any
to
lay
hold
of
them
beforehand
for
me
who
better
than
any
other
I
am
sure
may
prevail
with
his
brother
to
whose
share
I
conceive
they
will
fall
for
I
am
a
very
diligent
gatherer
of
all
I
can
get
of
Holbein's
or
any
other
excellent
master's
hand
I
do
not
care
at
what
rate
I
have
them
for
price
but
shall
think
it
an
extraordinary
favour
if
Mister
Bacon
can
procure
me
those
or
any
others
if
he
know
any
such
thereabouts
upon
any
conditions
whose
judgement
is
so
extraordinary
good
as
I
know
none
can
better
tell
what
is
worth
the
having

Some
of
those
I
have
I
found
in
obscure
places
and
gentleman's
houses
that
because
they
were
old
made
no
reckoning
of
them
and
that
makes
me
think
it
likely
that
there
may
yet
be
in
divers
places
many
excellent
unknown
pieces
for
which
I
lay
weight
with
all
my
friends
and
when
Mister
Bacon
comes
to
London
he
shall
see
that
though
I
be
but
a
late
beginner
I
have
pretty
store
of
choice
pieces

Dear
Madam
let
me
hear
by
this
bearer
whether
I
have
not
been
misinformed
concerning
these
pictures
and
if
I
have
not
make
them
sure
either
for
me
or
nobody
and
be
not
curious
to
think
I
may
pay
too
much
for
I
had
rather
have
them
than
jewels

DEAR
CORNWALLIS
IF
this
honest
man
had
not
offered
me
a
means
to
convey
these
lines
to
you
I
had
sent
a
footman
of
my
own
with
them
to
let
you
know
that
though
business
here
falls
out
as
crossly
to
my
purpose
of
coming
to
you
at
this
time
as
can
be
(
the
King’s
journey
to
Thetford
being
stayed
yet
nothing
shall
make
me
leave
you
longer
in
doubt
that
I
make
promises
to
you
I
intend
not
to
perform
therefore
you
may
be
confident
that
if
the
hand
of
God
Almighty
impose
not
the
contrary
I
will
be
with
you
about
a
fortnight
hence
though
I
cannot
yet
name
the
certain
day
because
I
cannot
well
leave
this
town
till
the
Court
removes
to
Greenwich
which
will
be
about
that
time
but
no
day
yet
set
my
stay
with
you
will
be
so
short
as
I
wish
you
would
resolve
my
journey
might
be
to
fetch
you
to
London
where
I
might
have
your
company
longer
for
necessity
will
compel
me
to
go
and
come
post
and
rest
but
one
day
with
you
which
I
know
you
will
allow
when
you
shall
understand
the
occasions
command
my
being
here
which
I
reserve
till
we
meet
hoping
that
desired
time
to
be
now
so
near
yet
so
long
I
will
not
defer
all
my
thanks
to
Mister
Bacon
of
whose
care
to
do
me
the
kindness
I
unmannerly
desired
of
him
for
some
good
pieces
of
painting
your
chaplain
has
been
a
faithful
relator
and
made
me
a
thanklesser
debtor
which
you
both
shall
find
if
ever
it
be
in
my
power
to
witness
how
unfeignedly
I
am
Your
faithfullest
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

April
1618

To
my
dear
and
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

DEAR
CORNWALLIS
You
may
see
how
unable
they
are
to
dispose
of
their
own
times
that
attend
debts
and
other
occasions
by
my
no
sooner
sending
you
word
when
I
will
be
with
you
which
now
I
intend
by
God's
permission
to
be
on
Tuesday
coming seven nights
at
night
and
staying
with
you
all
Wednesday
but
on
Thursday
you
must
give
me
leave
to
return
homewards
for
I
must
needs
be
here
again
on
Friday
night

I
write
this
in
extreme
haste
therefore
excuse
me
that
I
say
no
more
but
that
I
will
ever
be
found
Your
most
affectionate
&
faithful
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

Bedford
House
this
7th
of
May
1618

To
my
honourable
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

SWEET
SISTER
I
must
needs
give
you
great
thanks
for
your
rare
and
bountiful
present
no
meat
in
the
world
could
have
been
so
welcome

I
pray
God
send
you
a
happy
journey
and
a
safe
and
quick
return

I
have
adventured
to
send
you
this
poor
plain
cakes
not
so
good
as
I
wish
they
were

Had
I
had
any
thing
of
worth
I
would
in
deed
have
which
in
these
ragged
linens
I
seek
to
excuse

I
have
so
many
charges
as
I
am
determined
to
let
my
gown
alone
but
if
you
will
do
me
the
favour
to
buy
me
so
much
mean
stuff
canvas
or
what
stuff
you
please
of
black
and
white
to
make
me
a
waistcoat
for
every
day
you
shall
do
me
a
great
favour

I
have
stuff
by
me
will
serve
for
this
lone
place
to
make
me
a
plain
gown
If
you
please
to
get
me
a
black
fan
bought
I
will
leave
troubling
of
your
Lady
but
never
leave
loving
you

I
wished
as
I
commanded
this
bearer
to
tell
you
that
you
should
not
lose
so
much
of
your
precious
time
of
entertaining
and
enjoying
so
honourable
a
parsonage
but
put
it
in
your
pocket
till
you
come
at
London
and
so
I
bid
you
a
hearty
farewell
resting
your
Ladyship’s
loving
unfortunate
sister
MARY
BATH

20
of
May
1618

I
am
bold
to
send
these
letters
to
which
of
your
attendants
you
please
to
command
to
get
them
delivered

Age
in
this
world
is
of
most
young
folks
much
declined

The
strongest
estate
I
stand
in
makes
me
of
no
esteem
and
that
which
I
profess
and
cannot
without
dissimulation
to
God
and
the
world
be
otherwise
makes
me
condemned
of
the
most
base
but
our
Saviour's
example
if
I
were
as
I
should
be
might
make
me
think
myself
to
suffer
for
Him
that
suffered
for
us
all
but
my
weakness
is
such
as
were
not
my
hope
in
His
mercy
that
He
will
not
suffer
me
to
put
up
with
my
cruel
fits
were
able
to
distract
me

I
protest
your
kind
visitation
did
much
relieve
my
vexed
mind
which
made
me
appear
to
your
Lady
as
impotent
in
mind
as
body
which
your
good
disposition
I
well
perceived
took
commiseration
on
and
made
you
pleased
to
trouble
yourself
to
give
me
comfort
in
desiring
me
to
come
upon
Monday
which
day
or
any
day
I
will
if
you
please
to
send
and
shall
if
my
fits
be
not
too
vehement
by
God's
grace
come
but
were
it
your
pleasure
I
had
rather
defer
it
till
Thursday
but
that
by
that
time
I
doubt
your
strangers
will
be
come
and
I
cannot
but
think
company
should
be
troublesome
to
you
at
this
time
if
you
know
any
coming

Sweet
Lady
do
not
send
for
me

When
you
come
home
again
by
God's
grace
you
shall
not
keep
me
so
long
from
seeing
you
who
will
ever
remain
Your
faithful
loving
sister
from
heart
the
most
unfortunate
MARY
BATH

1618

To
my
honourable
loving
sister
the
Lady
Cornwallis

DEAR
MADAM

Thus
you
see
it
is
not
good
being
too
free
an
offerer
to
a
free
taker
but
be
not
discouraged
for
I
shall
be
as
free
a
requiter
whensoever
you
shall
make
me
know
it
is
in
my
power

I
cannot
send
you
much
news
from
hence
the
best
is
that
after
many
difficulties
I
have
made
an
end
according
to
my
wishes
of
my
business
with
the
King
and
received
his
grant
with
many
excuses
for
the
delays
it
has
had
and
so
much
compliment
as
has
made
amends
the
worst
that
the
Queen
has
bled
extremely
of
late
which
has
so
weakened
her
as
I
much
fear
how
she
will
recover
it
for
I
never
saw
her
look
so
dangerously
ill
which
makes
me
oftener
a
courtier
than
I
intended
and
with
my
other
occasions
will
I
think
draw
me
to
winter
at
London
where
I
should
be
glad
to
hear
you
minded
to
go

Howsoever
I
think
I
shall
invite
you
towards
the
spring
to
do
my
niece
an
honour
if
I
can
compose
things
according
to
my
wishes
an
offer
being
made
me
for
her
pleases
me
well
and
I
doubt
not
will
take
effect
if
her
unreasonable
father
can
be
brought
to
do
what
he
ought
which
if
love
will
not
make
him
I
hope
fear
will
prevail
but
of
this
let
no
speech
pass
you
because
it
is
yet
too
early
days
but
as
soon
as
it
is
settled
to
any
certainty
and
that
the
King
has
declared
himself
whose
work
it
is
you
shall
hear
of
it
more
particularly
from
me
to
whom
it
will
be
of
a
great
deal
of
use
and
comfort
if
it
pleases
God
to
prosper
it

So
may
He
bless
all
your
endeavours
and
continue
to
add
to
your
happiness
which
is
not
more
heartily
wished
by
any
than
by
your
most
affectionate
and
faithful
friend

To
my

Lady
Cornwallis
at
Broome

DEAR
CORNWALLIS
I
MUST
not
let
this
bearer
return
without
my
entreaty
to
you
that
to
mine
you
will
join
your
thanks
to
Mister
Bacon
for
the
favour
he
has
done
me
in
furnishing
me
with
such
help
for
my
garden
and
let
me
beg
it
of
you
both
that
you
will
believe
that
I
shall
be
gladder
to
deserve
than
receive
obligations
from
you
though
the
demonstrations
of
good
will
to
me
are
not
more welcome
from
any
than
yourselves
whose
love
I
infinitely
prize
and
requite
with
the
best
affection
of
Your
most
affectionate

faithful

LADY
BEDFORD

House
in
haste
this
6th
of
November
1618

RIGHT
HONOURABLE
Under
this
date
I
write
two
letters
unto
you
whereof
the
present
is
the
latter
and
is
written
to
correct
the
former

For
whereas
in
the
same
I
advertised
that
an
execution
had
been
done
upon
certain
mutinous
persons
of
the
Holland
troops
that
had
fortified
themselves
against
the
general
on
the
shore
of
Dalmatia
(
which
I
took
from
the
first
voice
there
is
now
(
though
I
am
sorry
to
express
it
fresher
advice
come
from
the
armada
that
those
mutineers
were
English
and
of
the
late
arrived
under
Sir
Henry
Peyton's
conduct
to
the
number
of
some
150
who
demanded
the
same
pay
that
the
foresaid
Hollanders
had
and
made
that
the
subject
of
their
division

To
which
the
general
made
answer
that
he
would
stand
to
the
contract
concluded
between
the
ambassador
of
this
state
and
their
conductor
in
England
and
therefore
wished
them
to
be
quiet
which
they
refusing
he
landed
200
Albanesi
to
reduce
them
by
force
against
whom
the
English
turned
their
pikes
and
their
shot
which
the
general
perceiving
he
laid
the
prows
of
two
of
his
galleys
against
them
and
so
they
yielded

Barbarigo
upon
this
forming
their
process
did
hang
eight
of
them
who
are
said
to
be
captains
lieutenants
and
corporals
and
that
three
of
these
did
die
in
the
Roman
faith

Their
names
I
yet
know
not
which
shall
be
advertised
in
my
next

God
send
the
success
fairer
than
the
beginning

To
this
I
must
add
that
by
the
letters
of
Milan
arrived
at
this
moment
is
intimated
a
secret
conjunction
between
France
and
Savoy
against
the
Genovese
which
if
it
proceed
will
inflame
this
whole
country

These
be
resolutions
proper
for
the
canicular
days
which
are
newly
begun
with
us

Sir
I
take
presumption
upon
the
assured
promise
of
your
love
to
write
unto
you
herein
a
few
private
lines
about
myself
whereof
the
scope
is
this
to
beseech
you
that
as
you
have
obtained
leave
for
my
return
home
the
next
spring
to
the
comfortable
sight
of
my
gracious
master
so
you
will
be
pleased
likewise
to
deal
with
his
Majesty
in
my
behalf
that
none
may
be
appointed
to
succeed
me
here
till
my
arrival
because
when
I
have
settled
some
of
my
peculiar
occasions
I
shall
rather
wish
to
come
hither
back
again
than
to
be
onerous
to
his
Majesty
at
home
for
without
his
bounty
I
cannot
live

In
the
meanwhile
my
Italian
secretary
Gregorio
de'
Monti
(
who
supplied
the
place
all
the
while
that
Sir
Dudley
Carleton
was
at
Turino
and
afterwards
till
my
coming
will
discharge
it
with
fidelity
and
discretion
being
a
person
of
much
sufficiency
and
of
twelve
years'
approvement
in
the
King's
service

This
is
my
most
humble
and
hearty
request
unto
you
about
which
I
have
by
letter
prayed
Mr.
Bargrave
to
intercede
with
you
for
me

But
having
not
heard
from
him
I
thought
fit
provisionally
to
move
it
by
mine
own
pen
having
with
no
man
else
living
communicated
these
thoughts
about
which
I
shall
languish
to
receive
a
line
or
two
from
you

And
so
again
Sir
I
am
yours
HENRY
WOTTON

DEAR
CORNWALLIS
IT
is
one
of
my
misfortunes
and
such
a
one
as
I
assure
you
I
am
very
sensible
of
to
be
thus
far
from
you
in
a
time
wherein
I
perceive
your
love
would
have
made
me
that
to
you
which
I
as
affectionately
desire
to
be
as
to
have
myself
the
comfort
of
a
friend
by
me
when
any
oppression
lies
heavy
on
my
heart
to
whom
I
might
trust
my
cares
and
be
sure
they
should
not
only
be
safely
lodged
but
beget
a
desire
to
ease
them
as
far
as
were
possible
or
at
least
advise
how
to
make
them
lightest

I
remember
well
what
it
was
you
feared
at
your
last
being
in
town
and
I
am
sorrier
than
I
can
tell
you
that
there
is
such
a
resemblance
in
our
destinies
as
makes
you
like
me
a
true
professor
to
yourself
of
ills
to
come
wherein
I
have
seldom
failed

But
for
all
that
you
must
not
lose
courage
nor
let
your
kind
sensibilities
which
is
the
self-worthiest
thing
make
you
so
unkind
to
yourself
and
yours
as
to
yield
up
the
strength
of
your
resisting
reason
and
consent
to
sink
under
that
melancholy
such
heretofore
unexpected
distaste
must
needs
breed
in
you
which
I
grieve
heartily
to
hear
has
already
wrought
so
ill
effects
upon
your
health
and
so
strong
apprehensions
in
your
mind
though
I
trust
our
good
God
will
with
a
safe
deliverance
of
a
happy
birth
restore
you
the
one
and
if
you
be
not
wanting
to
yourself
so
assist
you
as
you
shall
to
your
contentment
overcome
what
causes
the
other
and
which
when
you
have
recovered
strength
of
body
again
if
you
find
to
continue
in
my
opinion
you
should
do
well
to
remove
hither
where
you
will
have
better
means
to
prevail
and
shall
have
my
service
if
you
find
may
be
fit
for
you
to
employ
me
or
shall
find
it
that
of
others
of
more
power
than
my
own
by
declaring
that
I
have
engaged
them
to
take
care
of
you
may
become
of
use
to
you
in
this
occasion
who
I
dare
undertake
shall
do
it
very
willingly
and
readily
and
perhaps
it
would
not
be
to
ill
purpose
if
there
be
cause

Therefore
if
you
love
me
be
not
scrupulous
to
make
use
of
them

It
is
now
high
time
that
I
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
both
your
letters
by
this
bearer
and
withal
how
I
apprehend
your
kindness
so
many
ways
expressed
to
me
in
them
but
no
words
can
do
it
and
so
I
beseech
you
to
believe
because
it
is
true
and
besides
that
I
am
far
from
undervaluing
for
misinterpret
I
cannot
the
liberality
you
therein
have
used
towards
me
which
is
much
more
than
ever
I
was
a
debtor
for
to
any
that
ought
it
not
unto
me
or
than
I
have
a
heart
or
will
to
accept
if
I
durst
at
this
time
say
I
would
refuse
what
you
so
press
which
your
kindness
only
and
the
knowledge
of
your
disposition
takes
off
the
shame
I
have
so
long
detained
yet
I
will
now
keep
it
in
my
hands
as
you
will
have
me
though
I
must
still
as
your
treasurer
not
as
a
legacy
and
that
you
will
live
to
give
me
time
when
I
shall
leave
the
world
and
be
witness
I
am
not
behind
hand
with
you
in
affection
and
desire
to
live
in
your
memory
be
confident
that
there
is
none
of
yours
to
whom
I
will
be
more
wanting
in
anything
I
may
do
for
them
than
I
would
have
been
to
my
own
if
God
had
continued
me
a
mother
and
were
as
your
request
is
in
general
and
extends
to
nothing
but
what
I
hope
you
believe
not
so
ill
of
me
as
to
think
I
would
not
without
it
have
done
and
more
I
beseech
you
if
you
can
think
it
to
any
purpose
impose
something
more
particularly
on
me
for
I
will
perform
it
as
I
desire
God
should
have
mercy
on
me
joyfully
I
confess
in
your
life
but
as
faithfully
if
I
outlive
you
which
whether
I
do
or
not
they
shall
be
no
losers
by
what
you
have
done
for
me
that
have
at
the
present
but
prayers
to
the
Almighty
to
repay
you
with
which
shall
be
offered
up
with
the
best
devotion
of
Your
faithfully
loving
and
thankful
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

Harington
House
this
20th
of
January
1618-19

I
will
God
willing
the
next
week
send
to
inquire
of
your
state
of
which
I
hope
to
hear
as
I
desire

To
my
worthy
and
dear
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

DEAR
CORNWALLIS
I
SEND
this
bearer
to
inquire
of
my
sick
friends
into
which
number
I
am
extreme
sorry
to
hear
Mister
Bacon
is
fallen
both
for
his
own
sake
and
yours
and
as
desirous
as
any
can
be
to
hear
of
his
amendment
which
I
heartily
pray
for
and
hope
to
receive
the
good
news
of
at
this
messenger's
return

I
heard
not
of
his
being
ill
till
my
Lord
Chamberlain
told
me
of
it
and
that
upon
that
occasion
you
had
excused
yourself
from
coming
to
the
Queen's
funeral
where
I
hoped
to
have
seen
you
and
am
doubly
sorry
upon
this
occasion
to
fail
of
that
contentment
ere
long
I
trust
a
happier
one
will
bring
us
with
gladness
to
meet
which
I
wish
to
you
in
as
great
a
measure
as
I
do
to
Your
most
affectionate
friend
and
servant
LADY
BEDFORD

The
King
is
earnest
to
have
the
funeral
hastened
and
says
it
shall
be
on
Saturday
coming seven nights
but
for
all
that
I
think
it
will
not
be
till
this
day
fortnight

I
heard
lately
by
Roben
Cornwallis
you
sent
to
have
borrowed
my
plate
which
I
did
faithfully
offer
and
such
poor
linen
as
I
had

Because
you
said
nothing
I
did
put
it
by
and
carry
away
the
keys
but
knowing
me
as
they
did
they
might
have
broken
up
the
lock

I
was
I
protest
heartily
angry
they
did
not
and
yet
if
you
have
any
further
cause
I
have
willed
you
shall
have
it
of
my
faith
and
take
any
desire
from
you
in
such
kind
as
I
do
think
you
love
me
otherwise
I
would
not
have
been
so
bold
with
you
as
I
have
been
many
times

Sweet
Lady
if
you
have
cause
to
use
it
before
I
come
home
I
have
sent
the
keys
by
this
bearer
to
the
same
purpose

I
hope
to
be
at
home
the
laterending
or
the
beginning
of
this
next
week

I
have
had
my
health
very
well
ever
since
I
came
hither
till
the
last
Wednesday
since
I
have
been
very
ill
and
am
not
well
at
this
present

God
give
me
grace
to
submit
my
will
to
his
pleasure
and
I
beseech
Almighty
God
send
Sir
Edmund
Bacon
to
escape
his
perilous
sickness
and
you
health
and
many
years

I
pray
remember
me
to
my
brother
Bacon
and
pretty
Fred
and
so
I
will
take
my
leave

16
of
September
1619

Venice
this
3rd
of
February
1619

Right
honourable
and
my
very
good
Lord
I
am
very
glad
of
this
opportunity
that
by
the
hand
of
a
gentleman
who
does
so
entirely
honour
you
both
in
his
continual
speech
and
in
his
soul
I
may
revive
also
with
your
Lordship
mine
own
long
devotion
even
since
the
time
that
I
did
first
contemplate
your
noble
virtues
when
I
was
a
poor
student
at
Altorph
which
were
my
happiest
days

For
what
have
I
since
observed
in
my
employment
but
a
few
maxims
of
state
too
high
for
my
capacity
and
too
subtle
for
my
nature
which
was
cast
in
a
plainer
mould

Is
than
at
least
my
fortune
emended

Alas
my
dear
Lord
let
me
not
think
of
that

For
when
I
consider
how
all
those
of
my
rank
have
been
dignified
and
benefited
at
home
while
I
have
been
gathering
of
cockles
upon
this
lake
I
am
in
good
faith
impatient
more
of
the
shame
than
of
the
sense
of
want

Yet
this
is
my
comfort
that
my
gracious
Master
(
as
it
has
pleased
him
to
let
me
know
does
love
me

For
the
public
affairs
we
stand
here
yet
very
ambiguously

The
land
was
long
since
quiet
but
the
sea
as
the
more
movable
element
is
still
in
agitation
and
we
are
artificially
kept
at
excessive
charge
by
a
mad
Viceroy
and
a
winking
Pope
while
the
King
of
Spain
in
the
meanwhile
stands
at
the
benefit
of
time
and
fortune
ready
to
authorise
or
disavow
the
event
according
to
the
success
which
I
take
to
be
the
sum
of
our
case

But
these
things
will
be
more
particularly
delivered
to
your
lordship
by
this
'redeemed
Neptune'
as
I
have
baptised
him
for
they
here
think
him
more
than
a
man
that
knows
so
much
more
than
themselves

And
in
truth
if
any
place
had
been
vacant
worthy
of
his
sufficiency
there
wanted
no
desire
to
hold
him
as
they
have
expressed
by
offers
to
himself
and
declared
in
their
letters
by
him
to
their
ambassador
and
most
of
all
in
the
confident
communication
of
their
affairs
and
desires
with
him
which
likewise
include
some
hope
of
their
having
him
again
as
your
Lordship
will
perceive
by
the
subject
of
my
dispatch
to
the
King
which
he
carries

I
must
add
hereunto
for
mine
own
part
that
I
have
been
glad
of
this
occasion
which
has
given
me
a
better
taste
of
him
and
of
his
fair
and
clear
dispositions
than
I
could
take
at
a
transitory
view
when
I
passed
my
last
duty
with
your
Lordship
in
Canterbury
and
I
am
likewise
almost
not
sorry
that
I
have
yet
not
seen
a
letter
which
he
tells
me
your
Lordship
wrote
by
him
unto
me

For
it
would
have
made
me
the
more
ashamed
to
have
done
him
so
little
service
here
that
had
brought
me
such
a
favour
though
I
am
otherwise
not
poor
of
your
Lordship's
gracious
lines
whereof
I
preserve
to
this
hour
a
great
roll
and
especially
one
which
I
long
for
some
hour
to
show
your
Lordship
because
I
know
in
your
nobleness
you
cannot
deny
it
though
in
my
meanness
I
could
never
deserve
it

And
here
I
will
end
your
lordship's
trouble
with
my
prayers
to
our
loving
God
for
your
happiness

Ever
remaining
Your
Lordship's
with
an
honest
heart
to
serve
you
HENRY
WOTTON

Whereof
he
has
likewise
a
testimony
from
his
Majesty
under
his
royal
hand
sent
him
in
the
time
of
Sir
Ralph
Winwoode
for
his
better
encouragement
after
my
predecessor
and
myself
had
represented
his
good
deservings

Now
to
return
to
myself

I
carry
in
my
breast
besides
that
honest
business
which
you
know
some
important
commissions
from
this
state
which
have
a
silent
reflection
(
though
not
meant
by
them
upon
our
main
end

These
I
shall
particularise
in
my
letter
from
Augusta
and
will
end
the
present
with
mine
humble
thanks
to
Almighty
God
for
the
happy
news
which
we
have
had
this
week
of
his
Majesty's
escape
from
a
painful
infirmity

The
same
good
God
yield
him
long
unto
us
and
to
the
Christian
world

And
so
I
rest
At
your
Honour's
commandment
HENRY
WOTTON

DEAR
MADAM
As
full
of
just
sorrow
as
my
heart
can
bear
I
return
you
affectionate
thanks
for
your
kind
sending

What
a
mother
I
have
lost
I
need
not
tell
you
that
know
what
she
was
in
herself
and
to
me

But
alas

this
is
but
a
fearful
comfort
to
him
and
his
friends
considering
her
estate
which
gives
him
too
much
cause
of
doubt
whether
she
will
ever
bring
any
well
into
the
world
or
no
for
certainly
this
took
much
harm
by
her
unruliness
both
in
the
breeding
and
birth

Yet
God
is
all
sufficient
and
I
trust
will
bless
so
good
a
father
with
the
joy
of
leaving
some
of
his
own
to
succeed
him
and
the
rather
am
I
encouraged
to
be
confident
He
will
show
favour
to
him
and
to
the
prayers
of
his
friends
therein
because
though
he
was
very
fond
of
this
yet
in
those
times
of
fear
the
child's
being
subject
to
some
infirmities
gave
us
he
ever
kept
a
mind
ready
prepared
to
resign
at
God's
pleasure
so
unexpected
a
blessing

Now
it
is
come
to
the
trial
I
am
confident
he
will
show
well
tempered
effects
of
that
religious
resolution
and
bear
with
patience
what
the
Almighty
has
done
though
it
be
more
to
him
than
the
loss
of
an
only
son
to
another
father

My
loss
of
a
dear
mother
came
not
so
unexpectedly
as
my
Lord
Chamberlain's
did
at
this
time
for
to
outward
appearance
his
child
mended
but
my
mother
so
manifestly
decayed
daily
as
I
could
not
flatter
myself
with
hope
she
could
continue
long
though
I
looked
not
her
end
would
have
been
so
sudden
yet
the
disease
she
was
subject
to
threatened
no
less
which
I
sorting
with
that
opinion
she
ever
had
since
I
knew
her
that
her
end
would
be
sudden
made
it
I
thank
God
not
so
to
her
who
has
left
many
ceremonies
how
well
she
was
prepared
for
it
which
is
my
unspeakable
comfort

It
now
rests
for
me
to
follow
as
well
as
I
can
her
good
example
which
God
grant
I
may
in
living
for
his
service
that
I
may
die
in
his
favour
whom
I
beseech
to
bless
you
and
yours
and
you
to
recommend
me
affectionately
to
Mister
Bacon
who
made
me
hope
at
his
last
seeing
in
June
I
should
have
seen
you
here
before
this
time
where
you
have
not
so
true
a
friend
as
you
shall
ever
find
your
sad
servant
LADY
BEDFORD

Harington
House
in
haste
this
1st
of
June
1620

To
my
honourable
dear
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

I
hope
to
receive
it
signed
by
this
bearer
who
can
give
you
an
account
how
I
have
spent
my
time
this
many
months
at
whose
return
to
me
if
I
might
hear
that
you
would
be
shortly
at
London
it
would
bring
an
infinite
deal
of
contentment
to
Your
most
faithfully
loving
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

Leicester
this
12th
of
September
1620

To
my
worthy
and
dear
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

DEAR
MADAM
I
WAS
long
in
much
hope
that
you
would
have
held
your
purpose
of
coming
to
London
this
spring
where
I
have
been
constrained
to
be
almost
all
this
time
since
your
going
hence
which
has
made
me
the
greater
loser
by
the
change
of
your
purpose
as
I
am
much
the
sorrier
for
that
loss
since
your
want
of
health
has
been
the
occasion
to
keep
you
both
from
hence
and
the
More
the
places
in
this
kingdom
you
may
justly
challenge
to
be
welcome
to
while
they
are
mine
and
where
you
should
find
yourself
paid
with
most
affection
as
in
all
others
wheresoever
I
am
to
enjoy
your
company
which
if
I
did
not
believe
you
were
confident
of
it
would
be
an
extreme
increase
of
misfortune
to
me
since
you
could
not
imagine
any
good
to
be
in
one
that
should
requite
with
less
so
many
real
proves
of
affection
as
I
have
received
from
you
and
for
which
I
can
make
no
requital
but
that
of
loving
you
very
heartily
and
that
I
am
sure
I
do
and
doubt
not
of
your
being
so
assured
after
which
no
more
is
needful
to
be
said
since
that
includes
all
in
my
power

You
have
sent
me
the
finest
little
beast
that
ever
I
saw
whose
beauty
may
excuse
many
faults
if
she
have
any

How
well
she
will
play
I
long
to
be
at
liberty
to
try
and
howsoever
she
prove
she
shall
be
much
made
of
for
the
hands'
sake
she
comes
from

Thus
I
am
ever
receiving
kindnesses
from
you
for
which
I
have
no
better
returns
than
thanks
to
make
of
those
dear
Cornwallis
receive
the
affectionate
one
I
send
you
and
when
you
can
find
any
subject
to
exercise
your
interest
in
me
on
be
not
sparing
to
make
such
full
trials
from
what
a
heart
they
come

I
know
you
have
heard
of
the
marriage
of
your
niece
to
Sir
John
Radcliffe's
son
and
how
slightly
my
Lord
of
Buckingham
has
performed
the
protection
promised
to
him

Harington
House
in
haste
this
present
Tuesday
1620

If
you
deliver
not
my
affectionate
salutations
to
Mister
Bacon
and
your
son
Fred
it
shall
be
the
ground
of
a
greater
quarrel
betwixt
us
than
yet
we
ever
had

To
my
dear
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

DEAR
MADAM
IF
you
will
do
me
the
favour
to
let
me
have
your
company
here
while
your
business
stays
you
in
town
your
lodgings
will
be
ready
for
you
tomorrow
night
to
which
I
hope
you
believe
you
shall
be
as
welcome
as
ever
you
were
to
any
place
and
may
as
freely
command
as
when
they
were
your
own
so
may
you
still
I
assure
you
esteem
them
as
long
as
they
be
in
the
possession
of
Your
truly
loving
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

Harington
House
this
Thursday
morning
1620
To
my
noble
&
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

DEAR
MADAM
I
THINK
it
long
since
I
heard
of
you
and
yours
whose
well
beings
and
happiness
I
most
heartily
desire
and
send
this
bearer
to
inquire
of
beseeching
you
to
believe
that
no
absence
nor
length
of
time
can
diminish
that
affection
in
me
I
have
so
many
years
professed
and
you
so
well
deserved
for
whensoever
you
shall
have
occasion
to
make
trial
thereof
you
shall
find
all
in
my
power
in
yours
to
command
for
your
service
to
the
uttermost
it
can
be
extended
and
that
I
shall
reckon
it
a
good
fortune
to
me
to
be
employed
by
you
in
any
thing
that
may
give
you
assurance
how
unfeignedly
I
love
you
whereof
it
were
an
extreme
contentment
to
me
if
we
were
nearer
neighbours
that
I
might
often
tell
it
you
which
I
can
do
no
more

But
it
is
in
this
as
much
more
my
hap
to
have
much
of
what
I
wish
not
and
want
what
I
desire

Yet
I
hope
ere
long
some
good
occasion
will
bring
you
to
London
from
whence
except
it
be
sometimes
for
a
day
or
two
I
shall
not
stir
till
after
Easter
term
my
niece
her
father
and
I
having
bargained
she
with
him
for
the
present
possession
of
her
land
and
I
with
her
for
her
possibility
in
the
lease
of
Combe
which
to
settle
thoroughly
and
provide
to
pay
for
will
cost
me
so
long
a
stay
here

So
as
dear
Madam
the
favour
you
have
so
long
been
pleased
to
do
me
I
trust
now
very
shortly
to
answer
with
a
just
account
and
payment
of
your
own
and
will
all
my
life
remember
with
due
thankfulness
and
requite
by
the
best
means
I
can
having
been
done
me
in
such
a
fashion
as
I
own
not
the
like
to
any
other
which
is
unfeignedly
acknowledged
by
Your
greatly
loving
faithful
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

Harington
House
this
20th
February
1620-1

Sweet
Madam
recommend
me
affectionately
to
Mister
Bacon
and
bless
your
son
Fred
in
my
name
as
I
beseech
God
to
do
all
yours

The
worthy
Lady
Cornwallis
my
noble
friend

DEAR
MADAM,—I
am
extreme
sorry
to
hear
you
have
been
so
ill
but
with
as
much
gladness
thank
God
for
your
good
recovery
whose
health
and
happiness
is
not
more
heartily
wished
by
any
friend
you
have
in
the
world
nor
indeed
can
any
be
more
engaged
to
desire
all
good
to
you
since
your
constant
affection
to
me
challenges
all
the
thankful
returns
an
indebted
friend
sensible
of
such
kindness
can
make
which
though
I
confess
myself
in
expressing
ceremoniously
yet
I
will
never
be
found
guilty
of
neglecting
any
real
proofs
I
may
give
thereof
when
either
you
or
my
good
fortune
may
call
me
to
do
so

I
have
myself
had
an
unhealthful
spring
of
this
which
I
hope
will
not
end
in
a
lame
leg
and
that
of
that
too
I
shall
not
long
have
cause
to
complain

The
greatest
news
I
can
send
from
hence
is
that
this
day
my
Lord
of
Arundel
is
committed
to
the
Tower
by
the
Upper
House
of
Parliament
for
refusing
to
make
a
submission
to
the
House
and
give
satisfaction
according
to
the
order
of
the
House
for
some
reproachful
speeches
he
had
there
used
to
my
Lord
Spencer
in
which
nor
his
refusal
to
make
a
fitting
reparation
he
has
not
played
the
part
of
so
wise
a
man
as
for
his
noble
Lady's
sake
I
wish
he
had

Sir
Robert
Chichester's
scurvy
dealing
has
broken
up
the
match
betwixt
his
daughter
and
my
Lord
of
Arran
which
drives
me
to
play
my
game
another
way
than
I
had
laid
my
cards
and
will
hold
me
a
Londoner
till
the
end
of
the
next
term
before
which
you
shall
hear
from
me
again
and
I
am
not
unmindful
of
what
any
way
I
owe
you
which
is
more
than
can
be
requited
by
your
truly
loving
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

Harington
House
this
17th
of
May
1621

To
my
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

DEAR
MADAM,—I
think
it
very
long
since
I
heard
of
you
and
therefore
send
this
messenger
to
bring
me
word
how
you
do
from
whom
I
should
not
have
been
so
many
months
without
hearing
but
that
for
this
two
last
I
have
had
so
much
ill
health
and
pain
as
made
me
for
a
good
part
of
the
time
unable
to
write
and
yet
has
left
me
but
a
lame
woman

Better
news
I
hope
to
receive
of
you
and
yours
which
I
pray
for
and
shall
welcome
with
a
great
deal
of
gladness
for
this
fatal
year
keeps
me
in
continual
fears
for
those
I
love
which
if
I
did
not
you
heartily
I
were
more
than
unworthy
to
have
a
friend

Mister
Bacon
I
trust
has
by
this
time
perfectly
recovered
his
long
sickness
which
both
for
his
own
sake
and
the
comfort
of
your
life
I
cannot
but
with
much
affection
inquire
after
and
do
so
to
know
when
you
intend
to
be
at
London
where
or
here
I
hope
we
shall
meet
this
spring
at
the
farthest
if
the
town
and
these
parts
continue
so
clean
from
the
sickness
as
God
be
thanked
at
the
present
they
are
though
all
the
market
towns
about
us
and
many
small
villages
Richmondsworth
excepted
have
all
this
summer
continued
infected
as
well
as
the
city
which
kept
me
from
sending
to
those
I
hoped
were
farther
from
danger
for
fear
of
conveying
any
to
them
though
God
of
his
great
goodness
spared
my
own
family
and
has
yet
reserved
me
I
hope
for
his
service
if
it
may
be
also
to
do
you
any
I
assure
you
I
shall
love
my
life
the
better
and
be
much
the
more
your
contented
that
am

most
affectionate

To
my
noble
and
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis
at
Broome

DEAR
CORNWALLIS
—
I
am
sorry
Mister
Bacon
and
you
are
so
punctual
observers
of
the
commandment
empties
this
town
which
it
is
now
too
late
in
regard
of
the
state
you
are
in
to
tell
you
that
if
I
had
thought
that
had
been
any
stay
to
your
being
a
Londoner
this
winter
I
would
have
done
you
the
service
to
have
gotten
you
a
dispensation
whose
company
I
should
have
been
extreme
glad
to
have
had
here
where
I
shall
be
for
the
most
part
till
the
spring
and
though
in
this
I
am
a
great
loser
yet
it
troubles
me
more
to
hear
how
apprehensive
you
are
of
a
danger
it
has
pleased
God
to
carry
you
so
often
safely
through
and
so
I
doubt
not
will
again
though
you
may
do
yourself
and
yours
much
harm
by
those
doubtings
and
ill
companions
for
all
persons
and
worst
for
us
splenetic
creatures

I
will
write
you
no
news
for
that
I
leave
to
Mister
Bacon
who
may
hear
in
the
town
very
near
as
much
as
I
know
since
what
is
like
a
secret
passes
underneath
and
so
sounds
not
so
far
as
this
end
of
the
town
only
I
will
give
you
my
testimony
that
the
Prince
is
the
most
improved
man
that
ever
I
saw
and
that
my
Lord
of
Buckingham
recovers
much
of
what
he
had
lost
so
as
you
may
see
that
the
only
wise
who
brings
light
out
of
darkness
can
favour
us
by
ways
we
could
not
imagine
could
have
produced
such
happy
effects

The
little
jewel
you
sent
me
is
a
treasure
being
the
finest
and
best
that
I
think
was
ever
of
her
kind
for
which
since
I
cannot
thank
you
enough
I
will
use
no
words
to
thank
you
for
at
all

To
my
noble
and
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

DEAR
MADAM
I
HAVE
been
hindered
from
sending
to
you
as
I
purposed
first
for
want
of
a
footman
and
since
by
the
sad
accident
of
my
Lord
of
Richmond's
death
which
tied
me
to
give
my
time
to
the
performance
of
the
charitable
offices
I
could
to
his
Lady

Now
I
send
with
a
great
deal
of
earnest
longing
for
the
return
of
this
bearer
because
by
your
brother
I
hear
you
have
been
ill
since
your
being
delivered
but
I
trust
it
is
no
other
than
some
indisposition
incident
to
childbed
and
that
I
shall
hear
you
have
recovered
better
health
which
I
wish
as
heartily
at
the
least
as
the
continuance
of
my
own

Howsoever
since
the
very
season
of
the
year
invites
you
to
it
let
me
persuade
you
as
soon
as
you
are
able
to
come
to
London
where
the
best
means
are
for
the
recovery
or
confirmation
of
your
health

You
know
your
old
lodgings
which
or
as
convenient
a
one
if
I
keep
you
out
of
that
shall
be
ready
for
you
and
I
infinitely
glad
of
your
company
and
Mister
Bacon's

I
never
so
much
longed
to
speak
with
you
and
to
have
you
out
of
that
solitary
place
where
I
hear
melancholy
gets
two
much
ground
of
you
which
is
so
dangerous
an
enemy
as
I
extremely
desire
to
have
you
so
near
me
as
I
might
offer
you
my
best
assistance
and
service
to
overcome
it
in
yourself
and
remove
the
causes
if
it
be
possible

First
my
Lady
of
Richmond's
loss
though
it
were
such
a
blow
from
Heaven
as
I
must
confess
I
never
knew
given
will
not
kill
her
of
so
strange
resisting
stew
are
our
hearts
made

She
was
the
happiest
woman
I
think
that
lived
for
by
her
own
confession
she
acknowledged
that
if
she
should
have
sit
down
and
studied
what
to
ask
of
God
for
outward
blessings
and
inward
comforts
of
this
world
more
than
she
enjoyed
she
could
find
nothing
to
desire
but
a
child
and
it
was
true
for
she
had
of
glory
and
greatness
as
much
as
a
subject
was
capable
of
wealth
of
all
kinds
in
abundance
health
and
extraordinary
beauty
even
at
this
age
and
above
all
a
noble
husband
that
was
the
love
of
her
heart
and
doted
on
her
with
the
same
passion
to
the
last
hour
of
his
life
that
he
did
the
first
month
of
his
being
in
love
with
her

Out
of
those
loving
arms
she
rose
not
two
hours
before
he
died
and
left
him
as
she
thought
well
only
troubled
with
a
little
pain
in
his
head
which
made
him
desirous
to
sleep
a
little
longer
which
and
his
death
was
so
quiet
as
his
man
sitting
close
to
his
bedside
knew
not
when
he
departed
but
fearing
because
it
was
the
day
appointed
for
the
parliament
that
he
might
wake
too
late
called
in
a
gentleman
of
his
chamber
that
used
to
wake
him
who
drawing
the
curtain
found
him
stark
dead

I
lay
by
chance
that
night
at
the
Cockepitte
whither
instantly
this
news
was
brought
me
and
I
presently
went
to
the
Duchess
in
whose
lodgings
was
to
be
seen
all
that
an
unexpected
calamity
could
show
of
sorrow

I
much
feared
the
first
violence
might
have
distracted
her
but
her
passion
had
so
liberal
went
as
I
think
it
wrought
the
less
inwardly

Her
hair
in
discharge
of
a
vow
she
had
formerly
made
she
cut
off
close
by
the
roots
that
afternoon
and
told
us
of
some
other
vows
of
retiredness
she
had
made
if
she
should
be
so
miserable
as
to
outlive
him
which
I
hope
she
will
as
punctually
perform

For
my
part
I
confess
I
encourage
her
to
it
which
some
say
hereafter
she
will
love
me
nothing
the
better
for
but
it
is
the
counsel
I
should
take
to
myself
in
her
case
and
therefore
I
cannot
spare
to
give
it

She
offers
to
deal
very
nobly
with
my
Lord
of
Lenox
yet
I
imagine
there
will
grow
differences
betwixt
them
out
of
his
Lady's
overgreediness
for
they
already
refuse
to
accept
conditions
they
had
subscribed
to
though
if
she
have
not
very
harsh
and
unusual
measure
offered
her
it
is
in
her
choice
whether
to
part
with
any
thing
to
them
or
no

The
Lord
Marquis
Hamilton
is
Lord
Steward
so
as
that
staff
has
had
the
good
fortune
to
pass
from
a
noble
to
a
worthy
hand
where
I
hope
it
will
long
remain

But
I
fear
I
do
ill
to
weary
you
with
so
many
lines
therefore
dear
Cornwallis
I
will
not
for
the
present
say
more
than
that
I
love
you
as
your
own
merit
and
the
obligations
I
owe
you
justly
deserves
and
will
never
be
wanting
to
you
in
any
trial
you
may
have
cause
to
make
of
Your
most
affectionate
and
faithful
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

We
have
much
hope
that
the
Prince
will
show
himself
of
such
a
temper
as
will
be
his
own
glory
and
the
good
of
these
kingdoms
My
Lord
Steward
has
taken
from
me
your
old
servant
James
Henly
and
George
Purser
whom
he
should
not
have
had
if
they
had
not
been
such
as
but
for
his
sake
I
should
very
unwillingly
have
parted
with

Recommend
me
sweet
Cornwallis
very
kindly
to
Mister
Bacon
and
to
my
friend
Frederick
whom
and
the
rest
of
yours
I
beseech
God
to
bless

Harington
House
this
28th
of
February
1623-4

SWEET
HEART
I
DO
long
much
to
hear
how
you
do
with
little
Jane
wherefore
I
have
sent
this
messenger
by
whom
I
desire
to
receive
an
answer

Upon
Wednesday
last
my
Lord
Marshall
was
here
at
Bury
only
to
see
me
I
think
for
this
place
was
out
of
his
way
to
Thetford
whither
he
went
he
would
have
come
unto
me
to
Mister
Pead's
but
I
prevented
him
by
attending
him
at
his
inn
where
he
was
pleased
to
favour
me
beyond
my
expectation

All
the
afternoon
I
waited
upon
him
about
the
ruins
of
the
abbey

If
the
child
be
very
sick
I
pray
do
not
hasten
your
coming
hither
for
your
presence
may
better
be
spared
here
than
there

I
recommend
my
best
love
unto
you
with
my
continual
prayers
for
you
and
yours
and
rest
Your
most
affectionate

To

give
these

DEAR
MADAM
I
SENT
to
White
Hall
presently
after
you
went
from
hence
on
Friday
but
my
Lady
of
Lenox
was
not
returned
from
Littleton
so
as
I
could
not
get
her
second
letter
to
the
Keeper
but
I
hope
I
shall
hear
her
first
had
the
effect
you
desired

If
more
you
would
have
done
by
her
on
Tuesday
when
the
King
is
gone
from
Greenwich
I
will
find
her
out
and
bring
you
what
you
desire
of
her

Therefore
let
me
know
how
your
business
has
gone
and
what
further
service
may
be
done
you
by
your
Ladyship’s
loving
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

This
is
like
to
prove
as
busy
a
week
with
me
as
if
I
see
you
not
here
I
doubt
I
shall
not
at
that
end
of
the
town

SIR

I
SEE
your
friends
had
needs
be
moderate
in
their
requests
to
you
that
have
so
liberal
a
hand
in
the
satisfying
them
for
my
part
I
must
give
you
the
discouragement
to
say
you
have
gotten
nothing
by
your
care
so
plentifully
to
furnish
me
with
what
I
desired
but
a
bare
acknowledgement
of
my
thankfulness
since
my
desire
to
deserve
well
of
you
and
since
of
the
obligations
I
ought
you
were
at
that
height
before
as
they
can
receive
no
increase
yet
this
do
we
the
right
to
believe
that
though
this
must
stand
at
a
stay
my
endeavours
shall
not
do
so
if
ever
they
may
find
such
employment
as
may
witness
me
to
be
in
deed
as
well
as
in
words
Sir
the
thankfullest
and
most
assured
of
your
friends
LADY
BEDFORD

Bedford
House
in
haste
this
6th
of
November
1624

When
you
come
next
to
town
we
shall
be
able
to
show
you
some
good
new
pieces
of
painting
at
Harington
House

To
my
much
esteemed
friend
Mister
Bacon
at
Broome

DEAR
MADAM
I
ACKNOWLEDGE
that
I
feel
so
to
the
quick
this
last
affliction
God
has
pleased
to
lay
upon
me
as
no
worldly
comfort
will
ever
be
able
to
prevail
against
it
for
I
have
lost
the
best
and
worthiest
friend
that
ever
breathed
whom
I
could
not
love
enough
for
what
he
was
to
me
nor
sufficiently
admire
for
what
he
was
in
himself
and
to
all
the
world
nor
can
I
ever
by
any
sorrow
satisfy
my
own
heart
that
it
is
such
as
I
ought
to
have
for
such
a
heavy
cross
which
yet
I
trust
will
be
a
means
to
fit
me
the
sooner
for
heaven
because
I
am
sure
nothing
on
earth
will
ever
be
able
to
recover
much
hold
on
me
not
that
God
has
not
yet
in
mercy
left
me
friends
I
love
better
than
ever
I
did
myself
but
this
has
made
me
see
that
I
must
have
the
best
friends
in
the
world
but
to
lose
them
I
know
not
how
soon
for
he
that
was
so
suddenly
taken
from
me
both
for
his
years
strength
health
and
temper
was
like
to
have
lived
to
much
greater
age
than
any
I
have
left
and
so
I
think
would
had
not
his
noble
heart
been
too
great
for
these
times
and
his
fortunes
in
them

But
he
is
I
doubt
not
now
where
nothing
of
felicity
is
grudged
him
and
has
left
behind
him
more
truly
sorrowful
hearts
of
both
nations
than
any
man's
death
now
living
can
make
again
and
many
of
us
yet
know
not
how
to
endure
one
another's
sight
being
deprived
of
his
for
myself
I
must
truly
say
I
am
a
maimed
body
and
worse
and
so
is
my
Lord
Chamberlain
the
last
person
left
of
power
that
I
can
rely
on
for
the
worth
of
his
affection
and
friendship
to
me
and
to
speak
freely
to
you
the
only
honest
hearted
man
employed
that
I
know
now
left
to
God
and
his
country
in
which
I
believe
you
will
hear
of
a
great
change
before
this
letter
come
to
your
hands
for
I
heard
this
morning
from
Tibauls
that
the
King
was
this
morning
in
so
weak
estate
as
there
was
no
hope
of
his
life
though
till
his
3
last
fits
there
was
no
more
doubt
of
his
safety
than
of
every
man's
that
has
an
ordinary
tertian
ague
so
fatal
a
year
is
this
to
great
persons
as
well
as
meaner

The
Lord
therefore
give
us
all
grace
not
to
delay
preparing
to
be
ready
whensoever
He
shall
please
to
call
us
and
then
the
sooner
He
takes
us
out
of
this
miserable
world
the
more
cause
we
shall
have
to
magnify
his
compassion

DEAR
CORNWALLIS
THE
good
news
of
Mister
Bacon's
amendment
was
exceeding
welcome
to
me
that
have
a
lively
sense
of
all
that
concerns
you
in
whose
discomforts
I
shall
ever
have
a
share
and
so
have
now
of
gladness
for
the
good
signs
of
his
recovery
which
let
not
your
affection
make
you
so
distrustful
of
when
himself
others
and
you
too
find
a
bettering
of
his
health
and
strength
for
when
nature
wins
upon
the
disease
it
is
an
argument
that
the
worst
is
past
though
lingering
sicknesses
are
not
shaked
off
at
an
instant
but
commonly
wear
away
by
degrees
as
they
came

Therefore
have
patience
and
afflict
not
yourself
while
God
I
hope
intends
you
your
hearts
desire
not
to
take
from
you
yet
that
you
hold
so
dear
who
have
already
learnt
so
well
to
submit
your
will
to
His
as
so
sharp
a
precept
needs
not
to
teach
you
obedience

But
howsoever
the
only
wise
God
shall
please
to
deal
with
you
you
shall
have
my
infirm
prayers
that
He
will
never
leave
to
speak
peace
unto
your
soul
nor
to
give
you
joyful
assurances
of
His
favour
whereof
if
it
be
His
will
I
beseech
Him
now
as
an
earnest
to
hear
what
you
ask
for
your
husband
to
whom
I
pray
you
recommend
me
very
affectionately
and
tell
him
as
I
did
you
that
if
it
please
him
to
make
trial
of
change
of
air
or
that
remedy
which
here
grows
daily
more
and
more
in
request
through
the
general
good
success
it
has
I
desire
except
you
will
be
in
London
to
have
him
that
ministers
that
the
oftener
with
him
that
he
will
choose
More
Park
to
be
the
place
he
will
remove
unto
which
I
hope
you
both
take
for
one
of
your
homes

But
if
you
had
rather
be
in
town
under
this
roof
you
may
command
all
I
call
mine
which
is
not
far
neither
from
my
cousin
Kellway's
house
who
I
dare
undertake
will
be
careful
to
do
you
and
Mister
Bacon
all
the
service
he
can

I
give
you
many
thanks
for
the
receipt
which
with
your
last
I
received

For
all
your
kindnesses
I
can
but
love
you
which
I
do
and
ever
shall
heartily
while
there
is
breath
in
Your
most
affectionate
and
faithful
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

Harington
House
in
haste
this
Saturday
morning
1624

My
Lord
of
Kensington
returns
instantly
again
into
France

To
my
noble
and
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis
at
Broome

DEAR
CORNWALLIS
I
HAVE
written
as
effectually
as
I
could
to
my
Lord
Chamberlain
who
I
think
if
it
be
in
his
power
will
do
what
you
desire

What
the
King's
resolution
is
yet
for
his
own
and
his
father's
servants
he
has
not
declared
farther
than
the
white
staves
which
are
to
remain
as
they
were
but
for
the
green
cloth
and
other
inferior
officers
both
of
the
household
and
chamber
it
is
thought
he
will
employ
his
own
and
dismiss
his
father's
because
he
has
caused
the
latter
to
be
all
removed
to
Denmark
House
to
attend
the
body
and
lodged
the
former
about
himself
at
Whitehall
and
for
aught
anybody
yet
can
discover
he
makes
his
own
determinations
and
is
very
stiff
in
them
having
already
changed
the
whole
face
of
the
court
very
near
to
the
same
form
it
had
in
Queen
Elizabeth's
time
suffering
none
but
the
counsel
and
his
bedchamber
to
come
further
than
the
privy
chamber
where
he
continually
abides
nor
the
counsel
to
go
further
than
the
privy
gallery
and
causes
it
to
be
strictly
kept
likewise

Into
the
presence
no
more
are
admitted
than
his
own
servants
and
gentlemen
of
quality

Of
his
bedchamber
he
has
sworn
none
more
than
he
had
before
but
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
whom
he
uses
very
well
but
it
is
hoped
will
be
governed
by
no
man
nor
will
he
admit
any
of
the
rest
as
is
thought

After
the
funeral
it
is
expected
that
he
will
make
some
alterations
among
the
great
officers
and
the
common
voice
is
change
my
Lord
Chamberlain's
staff
into
that
I
shall
never
but
with
sorrow
see
in
other
hand
than
that
that
held
it
last
and
bestow
his
upon
his
brother

Yet
so
far
he
has
not
yet
declared
himself
but
if
this
be
I
have
taken
order
that
if
any
power
remain
in
the
Chamberlain
for
the
gentlemen
ushers'
places
whethersoever
of
them
hold
that
staff
it
shall
be
alike
for
your
request
and
this
I
did
because
I
think
the
chamber
will
not
be
settled
till
the
principal
officer
be
so

This
I
know
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
from
one
you
believe
would
write
no
untruth
to
you
and
that
has
made
me
(
though
I
am
not
much
disposed
to
write
news
set
down
this
much

To
which
I
will
add
that
our
destined
Queen
is
with
all
possible
speed
expected
here
for
whose
coming
the
coronation
will
be
stayed
that
that
and
her
marriage
and
entry
may
be
all
but
one
charge
but
the
first
marriage
in
France
will
be
instantly
the
King
having
sent
his
proxy
to
the
King
of
France
that
either
his
brother
or
the
Duke
of
Chevreux
(
which
is
Prince
Joinville
that
was
here
may
dispatch
that
so
as
the
next
month
she
is
expected
all
else
being
fully
concluded
and
they
in
France
hastening
the
espousals

I
am
very
glad
to
hear
Mister
Bacon
has
recovered
so
good
health
whose
welcome
shall
ever
be
such
where
I
am
as
I
owe
to
his
merit
and
you
whose
labour
I
do
not
pity
so
much
but
that
I
wish
you
would
bear
him
company
to
this
solitary
place
where
I
do
not
desire
to
see
many
now
living
but
yourself
very
much

I
write
to
my
Lord
Chamberlain
to
let
John
Fenne
know
his
answer
because
he
came
not
back
hither
and
had
I
been
sure
when
I
should
have
seen
him
I
would
rather
have
spoken
than
write
though
I
know
in
effect
it
will
be
all
one
for
he
knows
by
my
lines
as
well
as
he
could
have
done
by
speech
that
I
as
earnestly
affect
the
success
of
my
recommendation
as
I
can
do
anything
in
his
power
to
do
and
I
was
so
loth
Mister
Glover
should
have
anything
to
impute
to
my
least
delay
as
I
write
so
late
the
last
night
to
my
Lord
Chamberlain
and
dispatched
John
Fenne
as
I
could
not
send
this
from
hence
with
him
who
went
earlier
than
I
was
awake
this
morning
but
make
haste
it
may
overtake
him
at
London

The
lying
Papists
cannot
be
content
to
want
my
Lord
Stuart
in
the
beadrole
of
those
they
would
have
thought
for
their
glory
but
whosoever
knew
him
living
I
hope
will
receive
no
such
false
opinion
now
he
is
dead
who
even
after
he
was
speechless
gave
evident
demonstration
(
being
asked
by
his
chaplain
that
he
believed
to
be
saved
by
the
merits
of
Christ
yet
by
the
folly
or
villainy
of
a
physician
waited
on
him
(
who
was
Popish
have
they
got
some
colour
to
invent
this
slander
which
I
trust
will
be
cleared
to
all
the
world
as
it
is
clear
in
itself
to
those
friends
from
whom
he
had
not
a
reserved
thought
and
that
knew
how
far
both
in
sound
judgment
as
well
as
practise
he
was
from
approving
any
point
of
their
doctrine
disagreeing
with
the
creed
we
profess

I
pray
God
they
knew
him
not
so
well
to
be
the
boldest
opposer
of
their
ends
as
they
used
means
for
the
shortening
of
his
noble
days
which
that
they
were
unnaturally
cut
off
there
are
strong
suspicions
in
the
most
because
being
at
first
by
the
testimony
of
all
the
surgeons
physicians
and
his
own
servants
as
fair
a
course
as
ever
their
eyes
beheld
in
the
space
of
three
hours
his
whole
body
head
and
every
part
swelled
so
strangely
and
gangrened
so
generally
as
it
astonished
them
all
though
the
physicians
affirm
to
have
seen
the
like
in
pestilential
fevers
when
the
spots
break
not
out
before
death
and
impute
part
of
the
cause
to
the
expedient
of
chafing
his
body
at
least
for
the
space
of
an
hour
before
he
departed
with
hot
cloths
and
keeping
it
too
close
in
the
bed
after

God
only
knows
the
truth
who
if
he
had
any
wrong
I
trust
will
in
his
justice
declare
it

It
is
true
that
when
he
was
opened
in
his
stomach
and
head
there
appeared
nothing
to
confirm
this
jealousy
which
makes
the
physicians
confident
it
could
be
no
poison
they
are
in
these
parts
acquainted
with
yet
both
myself
and
many
other
of
his
friends
rest
not
clear
of
doubt
though
but
upon
some
farther
evidence
it
is
not
to
be
stirred
in
but
if
ever
the
least
light
can
be
gotten
the
fear
of
all
mortal
men
should
not
hinder
our
just
prosecution
of
so
abominable
a
fact
which
yet
if
it
were
so
hastened
our
loss
but
a
little
for
all
his
vital
parts
were
so
decayed
as
by
the
judgment
of
the
doctors
he
could
hardly
have
lived
out
a
year
which
nobody
that
looked
on
him
could
have
suspected
yet
he
himself
told
me
this
last
winter
that
he
found
such
an
inward
decay
in
himself
as
he
knew
he
should
live
but
awhile
but
God
knows
I
conceived
it
to
be
but
a
melancholy
apprehension
seeing
his
health
better
to
my
thinking
than
it
had
been
a
year
or
two
before
for
his
spleen
seemed
to
trouble
him
less

My
thoughts
are
and
ever
will
be
full
of
his
memory
which
makes
me
tedious
when
anything
draws
me
into
discourse
of
him
yet
will
I
not
excuse
this
temper
because
it
is
a
duty
I
owe
him
in
this
detracting
time
when
those
that
durst
not
have
breathed
amiss
on
his
least
action
while
he
lived
will
now
venture
as
much
as
in
them
lies
to
slubber
his
fame
when
they
shall
think
themselves
out
of
the
hearing
of
those
would
make
them
keep
in
their
venom
or
make
them
smart
for
uttering
it
at
the
least

And
now
I
have
done
this
it
is
time
I
end
whose
love
and
respect
to
you
shall
be
endless
in
which
to
my
sorrow
you
cannot
have
so
much
advantage
as
I
have
satisfaction
to
know
myself
for
your
most
affectionate
and
faithful
though
most
unfortunate
friend

S.
Dear
Madam
recommend
me
affectionately
to
Mister
Bacon
whom
if
you
will
bring
hither
this
spring
I
hope
you
would
both
find
good
by
our
air
which
hitherto
has
held
free
from
infection
and
should
be
glad
to
see
any
of
yours
too
with
you

MY
MOST
HONOURED
LADY
I
CAN
let
no
messenger
pass
without
the
remembrance
of
my
love
and
service
to
you

This
town
affords
no
news
only
this
which
I
think
you
will
be
sorry
for
that
Mrs
Anne
and
Mrs
Ueare
Cooks
are
become
so
much
the
prouder
since
they
were
heirs
for
their
brother
is
very
lately
dead
of
a
burning
fever
and
the
land
falls
between
them

My
old
Lady
Cook
presents
her
service
to
you
and
is
a
sad
woman
for
the
ruin
of
her
house

My
Lady
Nethersole
is
not
yet
gone
but
goes
shortly

1625

My
very
good
Lord
the
wind
hangs
so
at
Northwest
that
I
doubt
neither
our
letters
nor
yours
can
find
passage
else
should
we
not
be
thus
long
in
suspense
by
reason
of
a
rumour
that
has
held
there
eight
or
nine
days
that
our
side
has
received
a
great
blow
wherein
Sir
Thomas
Winne
Sir
Walter
Devreux
Captain
Tubbe
Captain
Dakers
and
I
know
not
how
many
more
should
be
lost

Though
this
be
yet
but
a
verbal
report
without
any
certainty
by
writing
yet
it
is
generally
believed
for
all
news
commonly
proves
too
true

Our
parliament
that
was
to
begin
on
Tuesday
is
prorogued
till
the
last
of
this
month
and
it
is
doubted
whether
or
where
it
will
hold
than
for
if
the
sickness
increase
as
it
begins
it
is
thought
both
that
and
the
next
term
shall be
removed
to
Oxford
or
Winchester

Our
whole
number
this
week
was
379
of
the
plague
71
parishes
infected
17

We
have
many
proclamations
daily
one
among
the
rest
that
no
person
coming
from
places
infected
presume
to
come
near
the
court
another
for
the
repressing
of
the
insolence
of
our
soldiers
now
in
their
way
to
Plymouth
that
begin
to
follow
the
steps
of
their
predecessors
that
went
with
Mansfield
in
pillaging
and
spoiling
whatsoever
they
can
lay
hand
on

Our
navy
is
not
yet
so
forward
that
there
needs
such
haste

The
common
opinion
is
now
that
they
go
to
the
West
Indies
which
me
thinks
were
too
long
and
hazardous
a
voyage
for
such
a
fleet

Our
order
of
the
Garter
is
much
graced
by
the
election
of
the
Earls
of
Dorset
Holland
and
the
Lord
Andover

The
Earl
of
Northampton
is
said
to
be
gone
after
the
Duke
to
Paris
but
I
should
rather
take
it
to
be
the
Lord
Compton

Mary
I
cannot
conceive
the
reason
why
Sir
Paul
Banning
should
post
thither
this
day
sevenight
unless
there
be
a
purpose
to
lay
him
to
pawn

Sackvile
Crow
arrived
here
on
Thursday
from
the
Duke
and
brings
word
how
noble
he
and
his
train
were
entertained
that
all
things
go
well
that
the
delay
of
the
Queen’s
coming
was
only
hers
and
the
King
her
brothers
sickness
and
that
she
is
already
on
the
way
hitherward

One
of
his
principal
errands
is
to
carry
the
Duke’s
gay
clothes

I
hear
that
secretary
Morton
is
to
be
with
you
shortly
as
extraordinary
ambassador
and
comes
directly
from
Paris
having
his
entertainment
of
four
pound
a
day
allowed
from
three
or
four
days
before
he
went

The
Duchess
of
Buckingham
is
said
to
be
with
child
which
is
no
small
joy

So
with
the
remembrance
of
my
best
service
to
my
good
lady
I
commend
you
to
the
protection
of
the
Almighty

The
King
goes
toward
Canterbury
to
meet
the
Queen
on
Friday
the
27
of
this
month

To
the
right
honourable
Sir
Dudley
Carleton
Lord
ambassador
for
his
Majesty
at
the
Hague

My
very
good
Lord
I
am
sorry
to
see
our
ill
news
so
fully
confirmed
by
yours
of
the
7th
of
this
present
but
more
sorry
for
your
niece
Dakers
whose
case
is
every
way
to
be
pitied

I
cannot
so
much
lament
the
rest
whose
lives
were
well
bestowed
to
redeem
us
out
of
so
dull
a
lethargy
and
to
make
the
world
see
our
wonted
courage
is
not
quite
lost
for
I
could
never
commend
those
wary
gamesters
that
rather
than
venture
to
set
up
a
small
rest
sometimes
would
loose
all
their
money
in
stakes

We
talk
of
a
rich
Holland
East
Indian
ship
that
lay
last
week
two
whole
days
in
the
Downes
in
sight
of
the
King’s
ships
that
would
not
see
her
whereby
we
may
easily
perceive
how
the
world
goes

Our
soldiers
pass
daily
towards
Plymouth
where
Sir
John
Ogle
and
others
are
to
train
and
discipline
them

The
common
speech
runs
of
15000
land
soldiers
at
least
a
band
of
Bedfordshire
men
(
they
say
have
killed
their
lieutenant
or
conductor
and
are
run
away
and
dispersed

We
have
now
almost
every
day
posts
out
of
France
that
bring
word
the
Queen
is
on
her
way
by
this
time
as
far
as
Amiens
where
she
is
to
tarry
three
days
and
makes
account
to
be
at
Bologna
by
Whitsunday
eve
and
here
the
Saturday
after

The
pensioners
and
some
of
the
train
are
gone
before
but
the
foremost
were
the
Marquise
Hamilton
the
countesses
of
Buckingham
Denbigh
and
Anglesey
with
the
French
Lady
Carie
who
went
away
on
Thursday
with
intent
to
go
to
Bologna
where
the
Lady
Carie
says
she
must
cast
herself
at
the
Queen
dowagers
feet
for
ancient
favours

Here
is
a
new
world
of
Scottish
men
come
thirty
Lords
at
least
in
the
court
at once
but
it
is
hoped
the
King’s
journey
will
disperse
them
there
is
no
remedy
(
they
say
but
the
King
must
go
into
Scotland
to
be
crowned
which
yet
he
may
do
at
leisure
I
hope

Our
weekly
bill
is
not
much
risen
this
week
there
being
401
in
all
of
the
plague
78
parishes
infected
sixteen
the
Lord
of
Bristow
is
said
to
be
very
sick
and
in
danger

Quester
was
overthrown
this
day
sevenight
in
a
suit
about
the
postmaster’s
office
wherein
the
Lord
Stanhop
prevailed
against
him

This
day
a
great
cause
and
that
has
long
depended
was
determined
in
the
exchequer
chamber
between
the
Lord
Sheffield
and
one
Ratcliffe
wherein
Ratcliffe
went
to
the
wall
to
his
utter
undoing

I
was
minded
to
send
a
list
of
the
Ladies
that
are
appointed
to
meet
the
Queen
at
Dover
but
it
varies
and
alters
so
often
that
it
were
to
no
purpose
their
number
is
about
four
or
five
and
twenty
all
their
coaches
furnished
with
six
horses
which
comes
altogether
now
in
fashion
a
vanity
of
excessive
charge
and
of
little
use

Your
brother
Carleton
was
in
town
this
week
but
after
his
wont
came
to
fetch
fire
(
as
they
say
and
tarried
not
above
two
days

The
Lord
of
Arundel
has
played
a
friendly
part
with
the
Lady
Fanshaw
and
caused
the
King
to
send
for
all
her
pictures
great
and
small
which
may
serve
for
a
caveat
that
if
you
bring
home
any
you
esteem
he
may
be
the
last
should
see
them
least
he
reap
the
thanks

To
my
dear
husband
Sir
Robart
Harley
Knight
of
the
Bath

Sir
Doctor
Barker
has
put
my
sister
into
a
course
of
gentle
physique
which
I
hope
by
God's
blessing
will
do
her
much
good

My
sister
gives
you
thanks
for
sending
him
to
her

I
pray
you
remember
that
I
reckon
the
days
you
are
away
and
I
hope
you
are
now
well
at
Hereford
where
it
may
be
this
letter
will
put
you
in
mind
of
me
and
let
you
know
all
your
friends
here
are
well
and
all
the
news
I
can
send

that

Sir
--
I
thank
you
for
sending
me
word
I
may
hope
to
see
you
at
Easter
which
time
will
be
much
longed
for
by
me

I
hope
the
parliament
has
spent
as
much
time
as
will
satisfy
them
in
doing
nothing
so
that
now
some
good
fruit
of
their
meeting
will
be
brought
to
ripeness
which
is
the
effect
of
our
prayers

This
day
I
delivered
the
100
to
my
father
which
he
has
paid
to
Mr.
Davis
that
money
that
was
wanting
of
it
was
made
up
with
the
50
pounds
Mr.
Lacy
paid
for
wood

The
paying
of
the
new
park
is
made
an
end
of

Yesterday
your
company
only
was
at
Hereford
to
show
what
they
had
learned
where
Sir
John
Skidemore
and
Mr.
Vahan
were
judges
and
so
they
mean
to
be
of
the
rest
of
the
companies
and
they
have
appointed
ten
of
your
company
to
learn
the
use
of
their
arms
and
so
to
teach
the
rest

This
last
night
I
not
being
very
well
made
me
send
this
day
for
the
midwife
which
I
think
I
should
have
deferred
too
long

I
pray
you
present
my
humble
duty
to
my
father
and
my
lady

DEAR
MADAM
I
TAKE
extreme
kindly
your
sending
to
visit
me
which
I
should
not
have
delayed
an
hour
thanking
you
for
but
that
it
is
so
busy
a
time
here
both
about
what
concerns
the
public
and
my
own
private
as
I
have
against
my
will
been
hindered
from
dispatching
your
man
according
to
my
desire
and
purpose
but
the
assurance
he
carries
of
my
present
health
I
know
will
make
you
excuse
the
length
of
his
stay

My
fear
of
relapsing
makes
me
content
to
punish
myself
this
spring
by
following
a
course
of
physic
Sir
Theodor
Mayerne
has
put
me
into
though
I
am
very
incredulous
that
it
can
prevent
my
having
more
fits
of
the
gout
howsoever
when
I
am
troubled
with
any
they
are
accompanied
with
such
accidents
of
sickness
as
shows
they
proceed
from
such
humours
as
physic
uses
to
correct
against
which
I
have
too
rebellious
a
spleen
I
doubt
to
be
brought
into
such
obedience
as
not
faster
to
power
out
the
sourness
thereof
into
my
stomach
and
distil
it
into
other
parts
than
all
the
apothecary’s
drugs
will
be
able
to
correct

What
I
do
therefore
is
rather
because
it
shall
not
be
laid
to
my
charge
that
I
neglect
the
means
of
health
than
out
of
any
great
hope
of
cure
by
it
which
whether
I
have
or
no
God
I
trust
will
give
me
thankfulness
to
Him
and
patience
till
His
appointed
time
of
releasing
me
from
all
misery
of
which
we
are
yet
like
to
have
in
general
more
and
more
if
this
Parliament
and
the
King
part
not
upon
better
terms
than
yet
they
stand
the
King
having
declared
himself
stiff
one
way
and
they
growing
stronger
and
stronger
in
their
resolutions
another

They
have
had
some
way
given
them
which
is
understood
by
them
as
a
good
sign
of
the
King's
relenting
who
may
if
he
please
have
of
them
what
none
of
his
predecessors
ever
had
of
their
people
so
they
may
with
all
have
their
bargain
without
which
they
think
all
their
liberality
would
be
no
better
than
cast
away
what
the
event
will
be
a
few
days
more
will
show

All
other
kind
of
news
for
the
present
lies
dead
here
except
it
have
some
relation
to
the
Parliament
and
my
hour
of
persecution
is
come
therefore
dear
Lady
farewell

Let
your
love
to
me
and
confidence
in
mine
to
you
continue
alike
for
trust
me
the
one
is
highly
valued
and
to
lessen
the
other
you
shall
never
have
just
cause
given
you
by
Your
most
affectionate
faithful
friend
and
servant
LADY
BEDFORD

Believe
me
your
son
Frederik
has
my
prayers
that
he
may
be
so
blessed
from
heaven
as
that
your
comfort
in
him
may
daily
increase

With
many
thanks
to
Sir
Nathaniel
Bacon
do
me
the
favour
to
return
my
best
salutations
to
whom
I
was
extreme
sorry
I
could
not
at
his
being
here
do
those
little
services
I
ought
to
your
husband
and
my
respect
of
himself
but
it
was
so
late
before
I
knew
at
all
of
his
being
in
the
list
of
the
Knights
of
the
Bath
after
which
I
inquired
not
and
so
lived
in
ignorance
till
his
own
coming
to
me
as
on
that
alone
I
can
charge
my
ill
hap

St
James's
Street
this
last
of
March
1626

I
cannot
close
my
letter
without
being
a
beggar
to
you
to
help
me
if
you
can
to
another
good
and
fine
tumbler
being
a
commodity
not
to
be
gotten
in
these
parts

Thus
you
see
I
cannot
leave
my
custom
of
robbing
you

To
my
noble
and
dear
friend
the
Lady
Bacon
at
Broome

I
hope
your
cloche
did
you
service
between
Gloucester
and
my
brother
Brays
for
with
us
it
was
a
very
rainy
day
but
this
day
has
been
very
dry
and
warm
and
so
I
hope
it
was
with
you
and
tomorrow
I
hope
you
will
be
well
at
your
journey’s
end
where
I
wish
myself
to
bid
you
welcome
home

You
see
how
my
thoughts
go
with
you
and
as
you
have
many
of
mine
so
let
me
have
some
of
yours

Believe
me
I
think
I
never
missed
you
more
than
now
I
do
or
else
I
have
forgotten
what
is
past

I
thank
God
Ned
and
Robin
are
well
and
Ned
asks
every
day
where
you
are
and
he
says
you
will
come
tomorrow

My
father
is
well
but
goes
not
abroad
because
of
his
physique

I
have
sent
you
up
a
little
hamper
in
which
is
the
box
with
the
writings
and
books
you
bid
me
send
up
with
the
other
things
sowed
up
in
a
clothe
in
the
bottom
of
the
hamper

I
have
sent
you
a
partridge
pie
which
has
the
two
pea
chickens
in
it
and
a
little
rundlet
of
mead
that
which
I
told
you
I
made
for
my
father

I
think
within
this
month
it
will
be
very
good
drink

I
pray
God
preserve
you
and
give
you
good
success
in
all
your
business
and
a
speedy
and
happy
meeting

Your
most
faithful
affectionate
wife

I
must

humble
duty

My
dear
Sir
--
I
thank
you
for
your
letter
which
I
received
this
week
by
the
carrier
and
I
thank
God
for
my
father's
health

I
trust
in
our
good
God
in
his
own
good
time
he
will
give
a
happy
end
to
your
business

I
have
written
a
letter
to
my
father
which
I
send
you
here
enclosed

Alas

My
dear
Sir
I
know
you
do
not
to
the
one
half
of
my
desires
desire
to
see
me
that
loves
you
more
than
any
earthly
thing

I
should
be
glad
if
you
would
but
write
me
word
when
I
should
hope
to
see
you

Need
has
been
ever
since
Sunday
troubled
with
the
rump
in
his
face
very
much

The
swelling
of
his
face
made
him
very
dull
but
now
I
thank
God
he
is
better
and
begins
to
be
merry

He
inquires
for
John
Walls
coming
down
for
he
thinks
he
will
bring
him
a
letter

I
must
desire
you
to
send
me
down
a
little
Bible
for
him

He
would
not
let
me
be
in
peace
till
I
promised
him
to
send
for
one

Brill
and
Robin
I
thank
God
are
well
and
Brill
has
two
teeth

Ned
presents
his
humble
duty
to
you
and
I
beg
your
blessing
for
them
all
and
I
beseech
the
Almighty
to
prosper
you
in
all
you
do
and
to
give
you
a
happy
meeting
with
Your
most
faithful
affectionate
wife
BRILLIANA
HARLEY

I
pray
you
Sir
send
down
no
silk
grogram

I
hope
you
have
received
the
silver
candlestick

Your
father
I
thank
God
is
much
better
than
he
was

I

WORTHY
MRS
LONG
SINCE
I
wrote
my
last
letter
to
you
it
has
pleased
God
to
take
away
my
dear
and
loving
father
from
us
which
has
been
greater
grief
to
me
than
I
can
express

I
have
not
yet
received
answer
of
any
letter
which
I
have
sent
to
my
sister
which
I
marvel
much
at
and
she
does
the
like
as
it
has
appeared
by
some
letters
which
I
have
received
from
her
she
challenging
me
with
want
of
true
affection
because
she
has
not
heard
from
me
and
God
knows
I
have
not
neglected
any
means
whereby
I
might
send
to
her

My
mother
desires
to
have
her
kind
respects
presented
to
your
worthy
self
and
Mister
Long
so
with
my
own
to
you
both
I
rest
Yours
assured
to
do
you
service
SUSANNA
BURNEBYE

May
the
11th
1629

To
my
much
honoured
friend
Mrs
Long
at
her
house
in
Clarkenwell
Close
present
these
London

GOOD
MADAM
I
HAVE
lately
received
both
the
letters
you
sent
me
and
your
letter
that
is
directed
to
my
Lady
Meautys
which
about
a
fortnight
hence
I
will
most
carefully
send
to
Forneham
by
the
foot
post
that
lately
came
to
me
from
her
and
will
call
on
me
before
he
returns

I
also
lately
received
a
letter
from
Missis
Susanna
my
Lady's
sister
which
I
make
bold
herewith
to
send
your
Ladyship
that
you
may
thereby
take
notice
of
the
death
of
Sir
Richard
Burnaby
as
also
that
you
may
truly
know
what
intentions
are
towards
the
poor
child
on
that
side
but
I
leave
the
consideration
thereof
to
your
Ladyship’s
wisdom
for
I
do
this
only
of
my
own
head
and
your
Ladyship
may
do
as
you
please
for
all
me
but
truly
it
is
high
time
the
child
were
now
taken
into
some
better
keeping
for
albeit
the
nurse
does
her
part
to
the
utmost
yet
he
now
begins
to
grow
and
will
look
for
better
commons
than
her
wages
will
bear

I
sent
for
him
and
he
was
with
me
a
fortnight
at
Whitsuntide
last
and
I
perceived
how
well
a
little
time
of
change
did
alter
him
he
is
very
well
(
I
thank
God
and
comes
on
apace
he
can
go
and
prattle
a
little
and
is
very
pretty
company
and
thrives
the
better
for
his
good
aunt
Bacon's
allowance
which
is
weekly
sent
his
nurse
for
him

And
thus
good
Madam
I
am
ready
to
serve
you
if
in
anything
you
have
occasion
to
command
me
in
the
meantime
I
do
humbly
take
my
leave

To
the
right
worthy
and
my
much
honoured
good
lady
the
Lady
Bacon
at
her
house
in
Suffolk
&c.
&c.
Mister
Long
remembers
his
humble
service
unto
you

MY
MOST
HONOURED
LADY
AND
DEAREST
FRIEND
I
RETURN
you
humble
thanks
for
your
coach
which
brought
us
well
to
Colchester
where
I
met
Mister
Randolph
with
another
but
not
one
that
will
bring
us
to
London
before
Saturday
night
I
perceive
nothing
by
him
that
should
cause
my
stay
in
London
longer
than
to
see
my
mother
and
do
my
duty
to
her
for
she
finds
good
friends
to
help
her
to
money
out
of
the
Exchequer
and
that
is
all
she
is
like
to
expect
he
tells
me
yet
I
am
resolved
to
try
what
may
be
done
for
her
and
then
make
haste
to
kiss
your
hands
at
Broome
again
which
I
hope
to
do
within
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks

My
father
to
my
great
joy
made
his
last
actions
suitable
to
his
former
which
was
he
did
his
endeavour
to
sell
his
office
which
was
made
over
to
Mister
Randolph
before
and
came
so
near
it
as
the
man
was
in
the
house
with
money
to
pay
for
it
when
at
the
instant
he
failed
of
words
and
breath
so
nothing
was
done

If
Mister
Randolph
had
not
gone
as
he
did
it
seems
he
had
lost
his
office
for
my
Lord
Carlisle
recommended
one
to
the
King
which
he
appointed
to
possess
my
father's
place
Mister
Randolph
being
such
a
stranger
as
I
think
they
knew
not
what
right
he
had
to
it
but
now
they
are
persuaded
to
let
the
man
pay
for
it
and
be
his
partner
and
receive
half
the
benefit
which
he
might
have
possessed
alone
had
he
not
neglected
it
as
he
does
all
things
but
he
seems
glad
there
is
one
to
do
the
business
for
him
that
he
may
live
like
a
drone
as
he
did

I
am
your
most
true
hearted
cousin
and
humblest
servant
DOROTHE
RANDOLPH

1629

MY
MOST
HONOURED
LADY
MY
desires
and
intentions
have
been
to
have
waited
on
you
long
ago
for
I
thought
my
mother
and
her
business
would
have
been
better
settled
sooner
but
all
things
are
yet
as
they
were
and
nothing
to
be
done
about
her
money
till
the
King
come
and
till
she
know
what
to
trust
to
so
she
will
by
no
means
let
me
leave
her

I
have
no
hope
of
seeing
your
Ladyship
suddenly
except
some
good
occasion
bring
you
to
town

There
is
a
report
my
Lord
of
Dorchester
shall
marry
the
widow
which
if
he
does
you
will
be
still
the
stronger

If
this
or
anything
else
persuade
you
to
come
to
town
I
think
you
cannot
be
better
lodged
anywhere
than
here
with
this
woman
and
you
may
sojourn
with
her
or
she
will
provide
you
diet

She
has
made
a
fine
lodging
of
the
parlour
and
furnished
it
daintily
which
you
may
have
and
that
within
it
and
the
rooms
over
where
you
lay
before
but
they
will
not
be
long
unlet
for
there
is
many
desires
them
but
if
I
can
possibly
I
will
make
a
stay
of
them
till
I
hear
from
you
till
which
time
and
ever
I
will
be
Your
Ladyship's
most
faithful
friend
and
humble
servant
DOROTHE
RANDOLPH

1629

My
mother
presents
her
humble
service
to
your
Ladyship
so
does
Mister
Randolph
who
is
in
danger
to
become
a
statesman
for
he
will
not
spare
any
friend
or
occasion
one
hour
from
his
office

I
am
promised
to
speak
with
a
very
good
cook
that
served
in
a
Lord's
house
eight
years

MY
MOST
HONOURED
LADY
I
AM
now
I
thank
God
so
well
rid
of
my
pain
that
I
am
able
to
give
you
an
account
at
large
of
all
the
business
you
write
about
which
I
had
done
sooner
but
that
I
received
not
your
letter
which
I
imagine
should
have
come
on
Wednesday
or
Thursday
as
they
use
to
do

I
went
since
to
visit
Mrs
Dickson
and
in
discourse
fell
upon
the
old
business
but
she
made
answer
there
was
no
good
to
be
done
for
the
two
elder
daughters
there
was
now
a
treaty
of
marriage
between
my
Lord
North’s
son
for
one
and
Sir
Gervis
Clifton's
for
another
and
the
third
was
too
young

I
asked
her
what
her
portion
was
she
told
me
she
had
one
thousand
pounds
in
money
and
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
land
of
inheritance
and
they
valued
this
at
five
thousand
pounds
or
thereabouts

I
made
answer
I
had
not
heard
anything
of
it
from
you
but
I
thought
you
would
not
accept
of
so
small
a
portion
with
anybody
besides
you
would
rather
have
money
than
land
but
this
I
said
from
myself

You
may
give
what
answer
you
please
and
if
you
like
not
of
it
you
need
return
no
answer
to
Mister
Chitting
for
I
have
put
off
my
Lady
Barrington
from
any
hope
of
it
therefore
if
please
you
let
Mister
Chitting
say
nothing
that
he
has
acquainted
you
with
it
because
I
think
you
will
deny
it
and
I
would
have
nothing
hinder
the
proceeding
of
a
business
which
I
have
some
hope
may
come
to
good
which
is
this
As
I
was
with
my
Lady
Barrington
there
came
in
Sir
William
Curtene
a
Dutchman
and
two
of
his
daughters
the
one
of
which
was
so
conveniently
handsome
that
I
wished
her
my
cousin's
wife
if
she
had
ten
thousand
pounds
to
which
Lady
Barrington
answered
they
were
reported
to
have
so
much
a
piece
and
their
father
might
give
them
more
if
he
liked
the
conditions
for
he
is
very
rich

I
asked
the
lady
if
she
had
so
much
interest
in
them
as
to
propound
such
a
business
with
hope
of
success
and
whether
she
would
be
pleased
to
favour
her
friends
so
much
as
to
do
it
to
which
she
answered
she
had
some
power
there
and
would
use
her
best
endeavours
if
she
might
receive
full
commission
from
me
which
I
must
first
receive
from
you
and
so
will
proceed
by
your
direction

Now
to
give
you
some
account
of
your
friends
and
servants
here
of
which
my
mother
is
one
that
returns
you
many
thanks
for
your
kind
wishes
to
her
and
her
business
in
which
yet
we
can
do
nothing

The
letter
you
sent
my
cousin
Meautys
was
unsealed

You
sent
three
open
one
to
him
one
to
Sir
William
Plaiters
and
one
to
me
but
I
delivered
them
to
them
both
with
my
own
hands
and
I
think
they
both
believed
I
looked
not
in
them
for
if
I
did
not
my
cousin
was
very
testy
at
the
receiving
of
it
which
had
I
known
I
would
have
sealed
it
for
him

I
think
he
means
to
come
quarrel
with
you
for
it
if
he
can
find
no
greater
matter
for
he
intends
to
come
to
you
as
soon
as
the
term
is
done

MY
MOST
HONOURED
LADY
THERE
was
one
question
my
Lady
Barrington
asked
me
when
she
was
in
town
that
I
would
desire
to
be
provided
of
answer
from
you
for
her
against
she
come

She
desired
to
know
if
Sir
William
Curteen
asked
what
portion
you
would
demand
what
she
should
say

We
look
for
her
every
day
and
my
cousin
Meautys's
man
put
me
in
hope
I
should
see
you
here
between
this
and
Easter
which
was
very
welcome
news
to
me

I
have
enquired
after
matches
in
other
places
if
this
should
fail
but
can
hear
of
none
but
some
of
the
nobility
which
I
harkened
not
to
because
I
think
you
desire
not
to
match
with
them
yet
there
was
one
Lord
whose
daughters
were
so
much
recommended
to
me
that
I
did
not
absolutely
deny
it
but
thought
good
to
let
you
know

It
is
my
Lord
of
Bridgewater
and
Sir
Henry
St.
George
is
he
propounded
it
who
is
well
acquainted
with
him
and
thinks
he
will
give
six
thousand
pounds

When
you
come
I
hope
you
will
meet
with
one
to
your
liking
which
I
hope
will
be
shortly
till
which
time
and
ever
I
am
and
will
be
Your
humble
servant
DOROTHE
RANDOLPH

1629

MADAM
IT
is
much
your
goodness
if
I
am
not
within
your
censure
of
too
much
negligence
that
I
have
not
all
this
while
given
you
some
account
of
that
employment
you
honoured
me
withal
wherein
my
intentions
were
so
real
to
serve
you
that
I
was
loth
to
say
anything
until
I
were
better
satisfied
which
I
expected
to
have
found
in
more
forwardness
than
I
see
although
I
gave
them
time
to
consider
of
it
from
the
end
of
last
term
till
now
and
although
I
have
but
a
little
while
to
stay
now
in
London
I
set
this
afternoon
apart
for
a
visit
there
that
I
might
thoroughly
understand
their
resolutions
which
are
that
the
daughter
must
not
think
of
marriage
until
her
brother's
return
from
France
which
will
be
this
spring

1629

To
my
most
honoured
Lady
the
Lady
Bacon
in
Suffolk
at
Broome
this

MY
MOST
HONOURED
LADY
THE
Lady
Barrington
made
so
short
a
stay
in
London
after
the
receipt
of
your
letter
that
she
could
do
little
in
the
business
what
she
did
I
hope
she
has
or
will
shortly
let
you
know
yet
I
thought
fit
to
tell
you
what
I
know
concerning
it
from
her

She
went
to
the
father
and
told
him
that
out
of
her
love
to
him
and
the
good
opinion
she
had
of
his
daughter
she
came
to
propound
a
worthy
match
to
him
for
her
which
she
knew
he
would
give
her
thanks
for
when
he
knew
where
it
was
which
before
he
should
do
she
desired
to
know
if
she
were
free
or
he
had
no
treaty
with
any
for
her
to
which
he
replied
he
could
not
yet
give
her
any
answer
but
returned
her
many
thanks
for
her
offer
though
I
think
he
knew
not
who
it
was
she
wished
him

She
is
extreme
sorry
she
could
do
no
more
in
it
now
but
at
the
next
term
she
will
be
here
again
and
then
she
told
me
she
would
do
you
the
best
service
she
could
in
the
meantime
if
I
hear
of
any
other
I
will
let
you
know
of
it
for
I
do
most
earnestly
desire
to
see
him
married
because
I
perceived
a
wandering
humour
in
him
when
he
was
at
London
and
a
resolution
this
spring
to
go
into
France
yet
not
without
your
leave
as
he
said

I
received
this
much
from
my
cousin
Copinger
lately
and
since
you
were
pleased
to
like
the
other
that
came
from
thence
I
venture
to
present
this
to
you
and
with
it
the
best
service
of
Your
most
loving
faithful
and
humble
servant

MY
MOST
HONOURED
LADY
I
MUCH
wonder
the
Lady
Barrington
received
so
dry
an
answer
from
Curtene
for
she
was
very
confident
it
would
have
been
thankfully
entertained
and
that
an
extraordinary
portion
would
have
been
given
because
she
knew
he
gave
five
thousand
pounds
with
a
daughter
to
one
that
had
but
twelve
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
she
thought
he
would
give
rateably
according
to
the
estate
but
this
is
the
cause
I
perceive
why
he
makes
a
stay
he
has
a
brother
lately
dead
in
the
Low
Countries
and
his
son
is
gone
thither
to
see
how
things
are
and
till
his
return
he
will
conclude
of
nothing
for
it
is
reported
he
has
left
him
forty
or
fifty
thousand
pounds
and
then
he
will
look
very
high
for
his
daughters
yet
Lady
Barrington
said
he
gave
her
many
thanks
and
did
not
at
all
refuse
but
made
a
stay
but
it
is
not
worth
your
further
expectation

1629-30

To
my
most
honoured
friend
the
Lady
Bacon
at
her
house
at
Culford
present
this

MY
MOST
HONOURED
LADY
I
AM
most
heartily
sorry
to
hear
you
are
so
ill
as
your
letter
tells
me
which
I
received
with
the
dainty
pot
of
jelly
for
which
as
for
the
rest
of
your
favours
I
can
only
return
thanks
and
continue
constantly
yours

I
sent
a
letter
to
you
last
week
fastened
to
a
little
box
which
I
make
question
whether
you
received
or
no
because
I
heard
nothing

There
was
some
business
concerning
my
Lady
Barrington
who
will
be
in
town
by
the
time
this
letter
come
to
you
and
I
know
not
whether
your
resolution
hold
concerning
the
match
she
propounded
or
no
and
I
am
sure
she
will
ask
me
whether
she
shall
proceed
in
it
which
I
will
say
nothing
to
till
I
hear
from
you

I
hear
of
a
very
pretty
gentlewoman
that
has
six
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
her
father
and
mother
dead
but
there
is
eighteen
hundred
pounds
to
be
paid
to
her
grandmother
for
her
wardship
some
of
it

If
you
like
of
this
I
think
there
might
be
means
found
to
propound
it

Mister
Randolph
went
to
see
her
and
recommends
her
for
very
handsome
and
sixteen
years
old

1629-30

To
my
most
honoured
friend
the
Lady
Bacon
Culford

GOOD
MADAM
HAVING
lately
received
letters
from
Sir
Thomas
Meautys
touching
his
little
son
that
either
your
Ladyship
will
take
him
into
your
care
or
else
that
he
be
sent
over
to
him
as
also
that
a
sum
of
8
pounds
of
his
which
fell
out
to
remain
in
Mister
Long's
hands
and
was
kept
for
the
use
of
the
nurse
should
be
delivered
to
this
bearer
his
sergeant
I
have
thought
it
my
part
in
discharge
of
that
that
I
do
and
have
undertaken
for
the
child
to
move
your
Ladyship
that
you
would
please
(
if
it
may
stand
with
your
liking
to
take
the
child
to
your
custody
or
if
there
be
as
per adventure
there
may
be
some
reason
why
you
should
not
then
to
give
your
advice
what
shall be
done
with
it
for
I
will
have
no
hand
in
sending
it
to
sea
where
I
dare
not
go
my
self
and
that
whereas
about
Michaelmas
last
your
Ladyship
sent
me
5
pounds
to
provide
for
him
withal
I
have
laid
out
about
half
of
it
for
clothes
for
him
and
made
account
to
lay
out
that
8
pounds
of
his
father's
about
the
child
which
he
now
sends
for
to
be
delivered
to
his
sergeant
and
I
have
accordingly
let
him
have
3
pounds
which
is
all
that
is
left
either
of
your
Ladyship’s
5
pounds
or
his
8
pounds
and
so
you
may
perceive
I
am
a
bare
board
whereof
I
thought
fit
to
acquaint
your
Ladyship
that
such
further
order
may
be
taken
as
you
shall
think
meet

And
thus
with
mine
and
Mister
Long's
our
hearty
thanks
to
your
Ladyship
for
your
remembrance
of
us
and
mine
most
particular
for
the
gloves
your
Ladyship
sent
me
I
take
my
leave

Your
Ladyship’s
to
command
BRIDGET
LONG

2
April
1630

To
the
very
worthy
lady
her
very
good
friend
the
Lady
Bacon
this

MADAM
BOTH
duty
and
desire
do
by
the
assurance
that
your
son
has
ever
given
me
of
your
Ladyship’s
goodness
and
love
to
him
give
me
confidence
by
this
to
beg
your
blessing
and
his
pardon
who
thinks
himself
most
unhappy
in
your
Ladyship’s
displeasure
which
I
most
humbly
beseech
your
Ladyship
to
forgive
to
him
that
so
much
loves
and
honours
you
as
that
without
your
Ladyship’s
love
and
favour
restored
to
him
he
will
never
joy
in
anything
either
he
does
or
shall
possess
therefore
I
beseech
your
Ladyship
let
us
not
any
longer
suffer
the
want
of
that
which
will
make
us
so
infinitely
happy
and
though
by
want
of
the
good
fortune
of
being
known
to
your
Ladyship
I
could
not
hitherto
hope
of
any
favour
from
you
yet
now
my
endeavours
shall
ever
be
such
towards
you
as
that
I
will
always
approve
my
self
to
be
Your
Ladyship’s
most
obedient
daughter
and
humble
servant
ELIZA
CORNWALLIS

For
my
much
honoured
mother
the
Lady
Bacon
this

MADAM
COMING
to
see
my
cousin
Randolph
she
gave
me
encouragement
that
by
lines
once
more
to
tender
my
humble
respects
to
your
Ladyship
would
not
be
ill
taken
which
if
I
may
have
the
happiness
to
know
from
you
I
shall
not
fail
in
this
service
or
any
that
I
think
your
Ladyship
will
accept
of

And
for
the
last
letter
I
sent
you
I
assure
your
Ladyship
your
son
had
no
hand
in
it
for
it
was
written
before
he
came
home
and
sent
to
the
carrier's
after
he
was
gone
and
so
I
gave
it
to
my
cousin
Randolph
to
send
being
very
sorry
that
it
was
your
Ladyship’s
pleasure
to
give
occasion
to
write
to
you
in
that
style
for
there
was
nothing
more
contrary
to
my
will
and
I
hope
it
shall
be
the
last
in
that
kind
that
shall
pass
between
us
but
while
you
are
pleased
to
stand
at
this
distance
I
fear
my
husband
will
not
do
that
which
his
heart
most
desires
for
he
does
assure
himself
that
affection
you
once
had
to
him
is
clear
gone
and
that
it
is
hopeless
for
him
to
seek
your
love

I
hope
by
your
goodness
these
thoughts
shall
be
taken
away
and
if
the
King
and
Queen's
promise
to
yourself
of
doing
that
for
us
as
soon
as
they
can
will
be
any
satisfaction
to
your
Ladyship
I
will
procure
them
to
you
if
your
Ladyship’s
occasion
bring
you
to
town
where
I
shall
be
happy
with
your
son
to
wait
on
you
or
else
I
am
afraid
you
will
not
meet
a
great
while
for
he
dares
not
come
down
any
more
therefore
I
shall
wish
for
some
good
occasion
that
may
bring
you
together
and
make
a
hearty
friendship
amongst
us

But
give
me
leave
I
beseech
you
but
not
to
hinder
the
speediest
that
I
can
getting
of
what
we
have
promised
to
your
Ladyship
to
wish
that
the
friendship
might
be
before
otherwise
I
must
confess
to
your
Ladyship
that
I
shall
not
joy
in
it
and
give
me
leave
to
say
that
you
will
do
yourself
as
much
right
as
you
will
give
your
son
comfort
and
happiness

But
your
Ladyship
is
wise
and
knows
what
is
fittest
for
you
and
I
can
but
wish
you
the
greatest
happiness
which
I
shall
ever
wish
that
am
Your
Ladyship’s
if
you
please
to
accept
it
affectionate
and
obedient
daughter
ELIZA
CORNWALLIS

1630-31

For
my
honoured
mother
the
Lady
Bacon
at
her
house
at
Broome
these

RIGHT
trusty
and
right
well
beloved
we
greet
you
well

Having
taken
into
our
particular
care
and
contemplation
the
good
of
your
son
Sir
Frederick
in
regard
of
his
matching
with
one
who
serves
us
in
a
place
of
such
nearness
we
cannot
but
be
very
sorry
to
understand
that
you
are
displeased
with
him
for
doing
that
whereby
he
has
made
himself
so
pleasing
and
acceptable
to
us

Hence
it
is
that
we
have
thought
ourselves
tied
both
in
honour
and
charity
to
desire
you
that
you
would
not
out
of
any
misconstruction
of
his
proceedings
continue
to
withdraw
your
countenance
from
him
but
at
our
intercession
vouchsafe
to
look
upon
him
with
the
eye
of
a
mother
assuring
yourself
that
the
gracious
intentions
which
we
carry
towards
our
servant
and
his
wife
shall
extend
themselves
in
so
large
a
measure
both
towards
him
and
towards
you
(
if
you
will
make
use
of
them
as
at
last
your
own
good
nature
will
acknowledge
that
your
son
could
not
have
taken
a
better
course
either
for
his
own
advancement
or
for
your
satisfaction
than
that
wherein
he
is
for
the
present

And
so
much
you
may
believe
from
the
mouth
of
this
bearer
one
of
the
gentlemen
ushers
of
our
privy
chamber
until
you
hear
it
from
our
own
which
if
you
do
not
frustrate
the
King's
expectation
may
be
before
we
go
from
hence
till
when
and
ever
we
commit
you
to
the
protection
of
the
Almighty

Given
under
our
hand
at
Newmarket
this
four
and
twentieth
day
of
January
1630-31

TO
OUR
RIGHT
TRUSTY
AND
RIGHT
WELL
BELOVED
THE
LADY
BACON

HENRIETTE
MARIE
R.
RIGHT
trusty
and
right
well
beloved
we
greet
you
well

We
are
so
sensible
of
the
respect
that
you
have
showed
to
our
request
in
receiving
again
your
son
into
your
favour
that
we
cannot
choose
but
let
you
know
that
we
take
it
very
thankfully
at
your
hands

MADAM
THOUGH
I
have
not
the
honour
to
be
acquainted
with
you
yet
I
must
give
you
thanks
for
this
favour
that
you
bestow
upon
my
dear
cousin
in
entertaining
her
for
your
daughter
in
whom
before
it
be
long
I
know
you
will
think
yourself
happy
and
though
her
family
be
unfortunate
yet
you
will
find
as
true
an
affection
as
your
heart
can
desire
and
if
there
be
any
thoughts
remain
in
your
mind
of
the
disobedience
of
your
son
I
beseech
you
to
blot
it
out
and
be
confident
that
I
shall
esteem
him
as
one
of
my
own
and
what
is
in
my
power
shall
not
be
wanting
to
do
him
service
and
to
yourself
there
lives
none
that
shall
be
more
affectionately
yours
Your
faithful
and
humble
servant
S.
DENBIGH
1630-31

For
my
dear
and
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Bacon
these

DEAR
MADAM
As
I
concluded
with
your
Ladyship
at
my
coming
from
you
so
will
I
continue
to
pray
to
God
to
give
you
health
and
us
your
favour
in
which
we
shall
be
at
the
height
of
our
ambition
to
the
obtaining
whereof
we
shall
never
willingly
omit
anything
that
may
witness
our
desires
thereto
and
to
that
end
I
will
endeavour
all
I
can
the
speedy
getting
of
the
three
thousand
pounds
which
the
King
and
Queen
has
been
pleased
to
promise
us
the
which
so
soon
as
we
have
we
shall
most
gladly
present
to
your
Ladyship
till
when
I
beseech
you
accept
of
our
desires
and
by
these
my
humble
service
and
thanks
for
the
noble
welcome
and
favour
which
for
my
gracious
mistress's
sake
at
this
time
your
Ladyship
gave
me

But
Madam
I
hope
the
next
time
will
be
for
your
son
and
my
own
in
confidence
whereof
I
will
ever
be
Your
Ladyship’s
most
affectionate
daughter
to
command
ELIZA
CORNWALLIS

1630-31

Madam
Sir
Thomas
Stafford
my
cousin
Villers
and
Mister
Elliot
all
kiss
your
Ladyship’s
hands
and
humbly
thank
your
Ladyship
for
your
coach

For
the
Lady
Bacon
my
much
honoured
mother
these

MY
MOST
HONOURED
LADY
THOUGH
I
write
so
lately
by
the
carrier
that
my
letters
will
tread
upon
one
another's
heels
yet
I
could
not
neglect
the
presenting
of
my
service
to
you
having
so
fit
a
messenger
as
Sir
Frederick's
man
which
he
sent
to
me
but
him
self
I
saw
not
since
the
day
he
came
to
London
from
Broome
therefore
can
say
nothing
of
him
but
that
I
hope
he
continues
in
the
same
mind
and
dutiful
respect
to
you
that
he
professed
the
last
time
I
spoke
with
him

In
the
meantime
where
soever
I
am
I
am
and
ever
will
be
Your
Ladyship's
faithful
friend
and
humble
servant
DOROTHE
RANDOLPH

1631-2

To
my
most
honoured
friend
the
Lady
Bacon

MY
MOST
HONOURED
LADY
OF
the
business
I
most
desire
I
can
as
yet
give
you
the
least
account
for
I
have
not
seen
either
Sir
Frederick
or
his
Lady
since
I
came
to
town
only
once
him
in
Hide
Park
with
a
company
of
gentlewomen
in
a
coach
he
came
and
inquired
of
your
health
and
my
cousin's
and
that
was
all
that
passed
but
he
was
once
to
see
me
when
I
was
from
home
and
I
believe
shortly
she
will
come
to
me
for
I
heard
she
did
intend
it
but
she
was
ill
of
a
sore
throat
and
the
tooth-ache

Some
say
she
is
with
child

I
once
thought
to
have
gone
to
Greenwich
to
her
because
she
was
not
well
but
since
I
resolved
to
stay
and
see
what
they
would
do

The
King's
being
at
Greenwich
has
made
everybody
almost
leave
London
that
I
am
put
to
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
find
out
those
that
should
end
my
mother's
business
and
the
more
because
I
have
been
ill
after
the
manner
I
was
ever
since
I
left
your
Ladyship
at
Broome

My
Lady
Barrington
is
not
in
town
nor
will
be
this
term
but
Mister
Randolph
has
promised
I
shall
come
that
way
as
I
come
down
again
which
shall
be
as
soon
as
I
can

I
have
sent
you
some
patterns
of
stuff
such
as
is
worn
by
many
but
not
much
lace
upon
those
wrought
stuffs
but
the
newest
fashion
is
plain
satin
of
what
colour
one
will
embroidered
all
over
with
alcomedes
but
it
is
not
like
to
hold
past
summer

They
wear
white
satin
waistcoats
plain
raised
printed
and
some
embroidered
with
lace
more
than
any
one
thing
and
white
holland
ones
much

Mister
Chitting
recommends
his
services
to
you
and
will
bring
the
musician
with
him
which
when
I
have
done
and
inquired
of
Sir
Charles
Caesar
whom
he
serves
of
his
conditions
I
will
send
you
word
and
will
be
most
careful
of
all
the
commands
you
have
or
will
be
pleased
to
favour
me
with
or
what
else
may
give
testimony
I
am
your
faithful
friend
and
humble
servant
DOROTHE
RANDOLPH

1631-2

Since
I
write
this
letter
my
Lady
Cornwallis
came
to
me
but
not
Sir
Fredrick
for
he
plays
least
in
sight
for
fear
I
think
that
I
should
tell
him
his
own
but
I
am
like
to
do
it
the
more
next
time
I
see
him

I
told
his
Lady
the
manner
of
his
carriage
at
Broome
and
that
it
was
his
own
fault
he
came
away
upon
no
better
terms

She
professes
she
knows
his
heart
much
desires
a
sincere
reconcilement
and
the
contrary
if
it
continue
so
will
shorten
his
life
yet
I
perceive
not
him
to
be
so
forward
as
she
but
I
know
nothing
but
that
he
is
so
backward
to
come
to
me
where
he
might
further
that
he
so
much
desires

It
will
be
too
tedious
to
commit
to
writing
all
that
passed
between
my
Lady
Cornwallis
and
me
only
this
in
general
she
much
desires
as
she
says
still
to
do
anything
that
might
give
you
satisfaction

My
Lady
was
afraid
anything
that
she
should
write
would
be
unpleasing
to
you
but
I
strived
to
persuade
her
from
that
because
if
you
should
accept
anything
that
she
offers
you
might
have
it
under
her
own
hand
for
she
might
forget
what
she
said
to
me
and
I
might
be
accused
for
mistaking

I
think
you
were
never
troubled
with
so
tedious
a
letter
and
therefore
now
I
will
conclude
with
a
hearty
wish
of
all
happiness
to
you
and
yours
and
so
sweet
Madam
once
more
farewell

MY
MOST
HONOURED
LADY
I
FIND
my
Lady
Cornwallis
in
the
same
mind
still
of
desiring
your
favour
and
a
willingness
to
have
you
come
up
but
not
to
have
the
King
send
for
you
but
I
doubt
not
but
she
will
be
easily
advised
to
make
it
her
suit
to
you
to
come
that
you
may
receive
the
King
and
Queen's
promise
for
the
money
but
I
perceive
she
is
a
little
afraid
you
should
fall
upon
business
past
when
you
shall
speak
with
the
King
not
as
it
concerns
Sir
Fredrick
but
him
self
in
the
matter
of
his
injuring
you

But
I
shall
need
say
no
more
of
anything
since
I
assure
myself
you
have
received
satisfaction
by
Sir
Frederick
therefore
I
will
now
say
no
more
than
that
which
I
shall
ever
be
ready
to
make
good
which
is
that
I
am
your
Ladyship's
faithful
friend
and
humble
servant

Thus
entreating

To
my
dear
and
much
honoured
sister
the
Lady
Bacon

MOST
DEAR
Sister
NOT
long
since
I
had
the
happiness
to
receive
a
letter
from
you
the
which
I
was
not
a
little
joyful
of

In
that
I
was
so
far
remote
from
you
I
must
confess
it
did
grieve
me
in
that
my
being
was
so
long
in
England
but
now
since
it
has
pleased
God
to
bring
me
so
far
as
London
in
my
way
towards
the
Low
Countries
my
desire
is
to
receive
your
commands
for
so
soon
as
I
can
get
convenient
shipping
I
will
make
all
the
haste
over
that
I
can

Dear
Sister
I
must
acquaint
you
with
the
business
concerning
Sir
Alexander
Radcliff
and
my
Lady
as
yet
I
understand
by
them
how
their
estate
is
so
much
encumbered
first
by
the
occasion
of
their
debts
and
then
the
redeeming
of
their
land
the
which
her
father
mortgaged
unto
the
very
doors
of
his
house
that
until
such
time
as
their
own
estate
be
settled
they
say
they
shall
not
be
able
to
establish
any
certainty
upon
me
or
mine
but
so
soon
as
they
can
take
order
for
it
which
this
term
they
intend
to
do
then
they
have
both
promised
me
seriously
they
will
not
fail
to
perform
all
that
they
can
for
me

For
them
I
wish
them
much
happiness
and
I
must
acknowledge
I
have
been
very
kindly
entertained
of
them
both
all
the
time
of
my
being
there

Now
dear
Sister
when
you
shall
see
them
in
my
absence
will
you
please
to
put
them
in
mind
of
me
for
their
intent
is
to
see
you
this
summer

Dear
Sister
I
must
confess
that
I
am
ashamed
now
again
to
trouble
you
but
my
necessity
is
such
occasioned
by
my
living
and
tedious
travels
that
I
must
entreat
you
to
if
you
please
to
send
me
the
money
which
is
to
be
received
at
Midsummer

London
April
16,1633

MOST
DEAR
SISTER
THESE
are
to
entreat
you
that
in
my
absence
you
would
be
pleased
to
show
this
letter
to
Sir
Alexander
and
my
Lady
when
they
shall
come
unto
you
which
is
to
remember
them
of
those
promises
made
unto
me
at
my
being
with
them

The
first
was
my
Lady
whom
I
did
acquaint
I
telling
her
how
much
my
case
was
to
be
commiserated
the
promises
of
my
Lord
and
her
mother
being
now
violated
the
which
they
had
with
so
many
solemn
protestations
vowed
to
perform
to
me
concerning
the
jointure
of
200£
a
year
and
that
if
it
should
please
God
to
take
away
my
husband
what
would
become
of
me
and
my
poor
children
and
withal
I
told
her
how
much
I
did
rely
upon
her
goodness
whom
I
did
assure
myself
did
love
me
so
well
that
she
would
take
my
case
into
her
consideration
she
said
she
would
do
what
might
be
done
for
me
and
that
she
would
tell
Sir
Alexander
of
it
who
she
knew
would
not
be
against
any
good
that
she
should
intend
to
any
kindred
of
hers

Then
I
did
break
with
him
myself
and
I
must
confess
I
found
him
very
noble
in
his
answer
saying
that
so
soon
as
he
had
but
settled
his
business
which
he
hoped
to
dispatch
this
term
he
would
confirm
something
upon
me
which
he
said
must
be
some
of
his
own
inheritance
for
the
rest
he
said
was
all
entailed
only
discount
upon
his
son
which
is
80
£
a
year

He
did
solemnly
swear
to
me
he
would
not
fail
to
do
for
me
all
that
lay
in
his
power
and
so
did
my
Lady
too
so
that
when
they
have
settled
their
occasions
that
then
they
will
really
confirm
something
upon
me

I
and
mine
shall
be
ever
obliged
to
them
and
I
am
assured
God
will
prosper
them
the
better
for
their
charitable
performance

And
so
beseeching
you
to
be
an
assistance
to
me
in
this
business
I
shall
now
and
ever
continue
Your
most
affectionate
and
truly
loving
sister
to
be
commanded

The
shipping
is
now
come
which
I
have
so
long
expected
and
on
Saturday
next
I
mean
with
God's
permission
to
go
for
the
Low
Countries

I
have
been
much
beholding
unto
my
Lady
Cornwallis
who
was
pleased
to
come
and
see
me
and
after
brought
me
to
kiss
the
King
and
Queen's
hands

The
King
is
gone
for
Scotland
and
for
the
other
news
at
court
concerning
Mrs
Villiers
and
Mister
Garman
I
think
you
will
hear
the
relation
of
it
before
these
shall
come
unto
you
so
that
I
shall
not
need
further
to
write
to
you
of
it

Dear
Sister
I
give
you
thanks
for
all
your
real
favours
and
all
happiness
attend
you
and
all
yours
and
so
being
called
away
by
the
hasty
mariners
I
must
desist
to
write
but
never
to
love
you

most
assured
in

To
my

much
honoured

Lady

Favour
me
sweet
Sister
so
much
to
recommend
my
kind
respects
unto
my
sweet
nephew
and
my
niece
and
if
you
will
please
to
kiss
pretty
Charles
and
Hercules
for
my
sake
I
shall
be
your
servant

I
am
very
glad
that
my
brother
Raphe
is
come
to
London
I
hope
he
is
now
well

I
pray
you
to
give
him
counsel
what
to
do

I
desire
from
my
whole
heart
that
he
may
grow
in
the
fear
of
God
and
than
he
will
be
happy

Pinner
shall
send
some
wool
to
Leimester

I
have
here
enclosed
sent
you
the
acceptance
of
the
pursuant
by
which
you
may
know
his
name

I
do
bless
my
good
God
that
you
have
had
so
a
good
an
end
about
the
presentation
of
Bromton

I
think
you
have
done
a
very
good
work
in
recommending
Mary
Wood
to
my
Lady
Veere
to
home
I
hope
she
will
do
acceptable
service

I
am
told
of
a
gentlewoman
by
Doctor
Barker

My
heat
continuing
I
sent
to
Doctor
Barker
to
come
and
see
me
let
blood
he
came
on
Thursday
night
and
yesterday
morning
I
sent
for
a
surgeon
at
Bishop’s
Castle
that
let
Mrs.
Wallcot
blood
and
he
pricked
my
arm
twice
but
it
would
not
bleed
and
I
would
not
try
the
third
time

I
hope
the
Lord
will
direct
me
what
to
do
and
for
going
abroad
I
will
endear
to
do
it
as
soon
as
it
shall
please
God
to
enable
me

It
is
a
word
of
comfort
which
you
write
me
that
you
hope
shortly
to
send
for
your
horses

I
beseech
the
Lord
to
give
you
a
good
and
happy
end
to
all
your
business

I
thank
God
all
the
children
are
well
and
so
is
Ned
Smith

Ned
and
his

abroad

DEAR
MOTHER
I
HOPE
by
God's
great
mercy
to
us
our
sweet
babes
are
as
well
as
they
seem
I
humbly
beseech
Him
to
bless
them
with
His
saving
grace

But
Madam
it
does
heartily
grieve
me
that
you
are
so
sad
because
I
know
it
will
hurt
you
and
then
our
sufferings
must
be
more
therefore
good
Mother
for
God’s
sake
cheer
up
your
spirits
and
strive
all
you
possible
can
to
forget
what
is
not
to
be
helped
for
Madam
I
hope
God
will
be
so
gracious
to
us
as
to
keep
our
dear
Fred
and
bring
him
to
us
again
in
safety
and
then
Madam
we
shall
be
joyful
again

I
would
to
God
I
were
in
with
you
for
truly
I
would
do
or
say
anything
to
cheer
you
up
for
I
have
more
obligation
to
your
Ladyship
than
ever
daughter
in
law
had
to
a
mother
and
by
that
I
beg
of
you
that
you
put
an
end
to
all
sad
thoughts
for
me
for
Madam
God
has
so
infinitely
blessed
us
that
tomorrow
the
third
part
of
my
greatest
trouble
will
be
over
and
I
think
without
any
suspicion
at
all
I
humbly
beseech
God
that
I
may
never
forget
His
great
mercy
in
it

Madam
this
is
here
a
huge
day
of
triumph
and
I
have
taken
so
much
heart
and
courage
as
a
little
to
appear
amongst
them
though
it
be
but
staggering

My
Lady
Mary
and
my
Lord
Charles
are
married
and
they
say
there is
more
bravery
than
has
been
seen
a
long
time

So
praying
for
your
health
and
desire
of
your
blessing
and
prayers
for
and
to
us
all
I
humbly
kiss
your
Ladyship’s
hands
as
Madam
Your
Ladyship’s
true
affectionate
daughter
and
most
humble
servant
ELIZA
CORNWALLIS

January
8
1633-4

Madam
I
think
it
best
not
to
send
any
letters
to
my
husband
till
we
know
where
he
be

Now
what
in
the
world
to
say
to
this
merchant
for
the
present
I
know
not
because
they
say
that
if
bills
be
not
presently
paid
here
they
send
back
and
protest
them
there
and
then
nobody
will
trust
them
for
anything

Now
if
that
would
bring
him
home
it
were
no
matter
but
alas

I
fear
it
will
not
therefore
I
told
the
man
more
to
delay
the
time
awhile
than
for
any
hopes
that
I
had
of
the
money
because
I
think
there
is
more
paid
already
to
him
and
for
him
than
is
due
to
him
of
his
half
year's
revenue
that
I
myself
was
altogether
unprovided
of
such
a
sum
of
money
and
that
he
said
nothing
of
it
in
his
letter
to
me
but
I
would
send
down
to
them
that
had
the
ordering
of
his
business
to
see
if
there
were
any
money
to
be
had
but
named
nobody

I
told
him
it
would
be
near
a
fortnight
before
I
could
hear
an
answer
which
time
he
was
content
to
stay
before
he
sent
back
to
protest
him

Now
I
beseech
you
Madam
give
me
your
advice
what
to
say
to
him
for
I
know
not
where
to
have
the
money
for
as
for
that
that
I
am
to
have
for
the
half
year
I
have
so
long
promised
payment
of
what
I
can
possibly
spare
that
I
should
be
loth
to
fail
them
if
I
wanted
not
food
for
my
servants
and
myself
being
my
husband
has
a
competence
besides
for
out
of
150£
I
am
sure
I
have
promised
above
6
score
pound
shift
as
I
can
and
they
come
and
send
daily
for
it
but
as
yet
we
can
get
none
out
of
the
Exchequer

I
humbly
beseech
God
to
preserve
my
poor
husband
and
bring
him
home
in
safety
to
us
but
Madam
these
2
months
are
mighty
long

But
good
Mother
I
beseech
you
be
you
cheerly
and
make
much
of
your
self
and
with
these
receive
my
humble
thanks
for
our
poor
sweet
babes
whom
I
most
humbly
beseech
Almighty
God
to
bless
with
His
saving
grace

Truly
Madam
I
long
to
see
them
and
you
and
you
and
them
and
I
hope
the
Queen's
being
with
child
which
now
begins
to
be
publicly
spoken
of
shall
be
no
hindrance
to
my
coming
to
your
Ladyship
though
I
fear
it
will
be
to
my
stay
with
you
for
the
Queen
had
given
me
leave
to
a
come
to
your
Ladyship
when
she
had
gone
her
progress
and
then
I
should
have
had
too
months
or
6
weeks
to
have
stayed
with
you
and
now
I
fear
I
shall
be
cut
short
of
that
time

I
have

To
my
very
loving
friend
Mr.
Storie
at
the
Sign
of
the
Dog
in
the
Royal
Exchange
London
deliver
this

MR

Building
of
hospitals
provides
for
men's
bodies
to
build
material
temples
is
judged
a
work
of
piety
but
they
that
procure
spiritual
food
they
that
build
up
spiritual
temples
they
are
the
men
truly
charitable
truly
pious

Such
a
work
as
this
was
your
erecting
the
lecture
in
our
country
in
the
which
you
placed
Dr.
Wells
a
man
of
goodness
and
industry
and
ability
to
do
good
every
way
not
short
of
any
I
know
in
England
and
I
am
persuaded
that
since
his
coming
the
Lord
has
by
him
wrought
much
good
among
us

It
only
remains
how
that
He
who
first
moved
you
to
this
put
you
forward
in
the
continuance
thereof
it
was
the
Lord
and
therefore
to
Him
lift
we
up
our
hearts
that
He
would
perfect
it

And
surely
Mr.
Storie
it
were
a
piteous
thing
to
see
a
lecture
fall
in
the
hands
of
so
many
able
and
godly
men
as
I
am
persuaded
the
founders
of
this
are
in
these
times
wherein
we
see
they
are
suppressed
with
too
much
haste
and
violence
by
the
enemies
of
God
his
Truth

Far
be
it
that
so
much
guilt
should
stick
to
your
hands
who
live
in
a
city
so
renowned
for
the
clear
shining
light
of
the
Gospel

You
know
Mr.
Storie
to
withdraw
the
pay
is
to
let
fall
the
lecture
for
who
goes
to
warfare
at
his
own
cost

I
beseech
you
therefore
in
the
bowels
of
Jesus
Christ
put
it
forward
and
let
the
good
man
have
his
pay

The
souls
of
God's
children
will
bless
you
for
it
and
so
shall
I
and
ever
rest
Your
loving
friend

the

DEAR
MOTHER
IT
was
your
favour
to
me
that
made
me
send
to
the
carrier
to
inquire
after
my
letters
which
I
should
be
much
to
blame
to
neglect
without
just
excuse
since
you
are
pleased
to
give
them
so
good
acceptance
but
I
believe
the
carriers
or
some
belonging
to
them
very
faulty

I
am
sure
they
have
been
so
to
me
this
winter

I
had
my
man
Woddull
at
Newmarket
this
week
and
it
was
some
trouble
to
my
mind
that
he
should
come
so
near
and
not
wait
of
your
Ladyship
but
his
business
was
not
mine
but
my
Lady
Holland's
for
she
borrowed
him
to
go
to
Cambrey
upon
the
report
that
the
Prince
Elector
would
not
go
there

Madam
I
humbly
thank
you
for
your
good
news
of
my
husband
and
his
bairns
and
for
your
love
and
favour
to
us
all
which
I
beseech
God
to
reward
you
for
us
all
with
His
saving
grace
and
I
believe
that
if
my
husband
had
stayed
longer
with
your
Ladyship
which
I
should
have
been
glad
of
he
would
have
been
clean
well
but
I
hear
he
means
to
be
here
Saturday
therefore
I
will
not
write
to
him

Madam
I
have
not
seen
Mister
Morse
but
I
did
much
fear
that
he
would
be
so
near
coming
up
when
my
husband
came
down
that
there
would
be
nothing
now
done
in
his
business
and
Mister
Morse
told
me
that
your
Ladyship
might
have
assurance
and
the
remainder
settled
there
as
well
as
here
which
I
was
very
glad
of
for
I
know
your
Ladyship
cannot
come
here
but
with
much
trouble
and
charge
and
we
had
need
be
as
sparing
of
that
as
we
can
in
small
matters
since
necessity
forces
us
to
crave
your
assistance
in
so
great
a
proportion
for
truly
Madam
if
you
do
not
help
I
much
fear
all
will
be
naught

But
truly
Madam
my
husband
is
very
good
but
if
he
put
his
estate
into
a
stranger's
hand
I
shall
never
look
to
see
any
part
of
it
again
but
for
your
favour
to
me
in
desiring
to
keep
my
jointure
free
I
cannot
say
enough
but
I
shall
lay
it
up
in
a
thankful
heart
with
your
many
other
kindnesses

But
I
hope
my
husband
will
be
willing
to
give
your
Ladyship
any
assurance
that
you
please
and
truly
Madam
the
more
tie
you
have
upon
him
and
his
estate
the
gladder
I
shall
be
for
I
verily
believe
it
will
be
best
for
him
and
I
pray
God
give
us
all
a
happy
meeting

DEAR
SISTER
ALTHOUGH
I
have
written
divers
letters
unto
you
of
which
as
yet
I
have
not
received
any
answer
of
them
yet
such
is
my
affection

you

you

summer
again
from
us

I
have
not
seen
him
this
half
year
and
I
fear
a
winter
campaign
will
detain
him
the
longer
from
me
in
that
he
has
the
command
over

Queen

me
that
honour
to
be
godmother

my
child
the
which
I
was
ignorant
of
until
the
Queen's
return
from
Rine

I
told
her
Majesty
that
you
was
the
other
godmother
the
which
she
was
very
well
pleased
to
understand
her
Majesty
telling
of
me
that
she
did
know
you
to
be
a
lady
that
was
indued
with
a
great
deal
of
honour
and
virtue
and
that
in
her
knowledge
you
did
love
your
brother
very
well
which
was
a
thing
most
recommendable

you

does
lie
in
her
power
to
do
me
good
she
will
not
fail
to
perform
it
she
was
pleased
to
give
unto
my
little
Jane

fine
present

DEAR
MOTHER
I
HOPE
you
have
by
this
time
recovered
the
weariness
of
your
journey
and
given
our
babes
leave
to
come
to
you

My
Lady
Nuport’s
daughters’
was
not
the
plague
thanks
be
to
God

Truly
Madam
I
did
much
fear
your
being
very
weary
of
so
long
and
solitary
a
journey
and
my
husband
said
that
he
was
sorry
he
was
put
to
ask
to
stay
for
that
case
stays
him
still
in
town
as
he
says
to
me
for
I
have
not
as
yet
seen
him
since
that
day
that
you
went
out
of
town
but
he
on
Sunday
sent
Mister
Tom
Howard
to
me
that
I
would
be
ready
to
go
into
the
beginning
of
the
next
week

I
sent
him
word
I
would
do
what
I
could
but
now
I
think
I
shall
not
come
so
soon
because
the
Queen
is
now
resolved
to
stay
here
till
Michaelmas
and
I
have
been
some
times
away
of
late
so
that
I
should
do
well
to
wait
a
fortnight
or
3
weeks
and
besides
I
would
willingly
know
what
will
become
of
my
mother's
apparel
affair
so
that
I
wrote
to
my
husband
by
this
messenger
not
to
stay
for
me
after
he
have
dispatched
his
own
affairs
and
when
I
am
coming
down
I
will
beg
the
favour
of
your
coach's
meeting
me
at
Madam
I
can
say
nothing
of
Sir
Thomas
only
as
soon
as
you
were
gone
he
went
to
lead
me
up
to
your
chamber
and
then
he
said
to
me
and
I
to
him
as
before
and
so
he
went
away
and
I
saw
him
no
more

Then
my
husband
and
I
went
to
bed
into
your
bed
and
at
nine
o'clock
I
rose
and
sent
for
Mister
Morse
who
read
all
the
writings
to
my
husband
as
he
lay
and
then
he
sealed
them
and
bade
Mister
Morse
put
them
with
the
writings

I
wished
the
fine
and
all
had
been
passed
but
I
hope
it
will

The
King
went
yesterday
to
Tibal’s
and
comes
not
till
Saturday

The
Queen
is
much
delighted
with
her
house

Truly
Madam
I
am
so
much
bound
to
you
for
your
love
and
care
of
me
and
mine
as
no
creature
is
more
therefore
all
I
can
say
is
so
little

But
God
reward
you
and
I
humbly
beseech
God
to
bless
us
all
with
His
saving
grace
and
to
give
us
all
a
happy
meeting

Ned
I
beseech
the
Lord
to
bless
you
with
those
joys
blessings
of
his
Spirit
which
none
but
his
dear
elect
are
partakers
of
that
so
you
may
taste
that
sweetness
in
God’s
service
which
indeed
is
in
it
but
the
men
of
this
world
can
not
pursue
it

Think
it
not
strange
if
I
tell
you
I
think
it
long
since
I
heard
from
you
but
my
hope
is
that
you
are
well
and
my
prayers
are
that
you
may
be
so

As
you
say
you
have
found
your
tutor
kind
and
careful
of
you
so
I
hope
he
will
be
still

I
believe
you
have
all
the
intelligence
of
the
Queen
mother’s
arrival
and
entertainment
therefore
I
will
omit
it

Your
father
I
thank
God
is
well
and
for
myself
I
have
not
yet
shaken
off
my
cold

Your
brother
Robert
by
God’s
mercy
to
him
has
been
yet
free
from
his
fits
and
goes
to
school
carefully
and
I
hope
he
is
now
so
wise
to
see
his
stubbornness
was
not
the
way
to
gain
any
thing
but
reproof

I
purpose
if
please
God
to
send
the
next
week
to
see
you

Your
father
prays
God
to
bless
you

Remember
me
to
your
tutor
and
I
beseech
the
Lord
to
keep
you
from
all
evil

I
have
sent
you
some
juice
of
liquorice
which
you
may
keep
to
make
use
of
if
you
should
have
a
cold

So
I
rest
Your
most
affectionate
mother

Good
Need
This
day
I
received
a
letter
from
you
in
which
you
write
me
that
you
had
written
to
me
the
weak
before
which
letter
I
have
not
received
so
that
I
thought
it
long
since
I
heard
from
you

It
is
my
joy
that
you
are
well
and
I
beseech
the
Lord
to
continue
your
health
and
above
all
to
give
you
that
grace
in
your
soul
which
may
make
you
have
a
healthful
soul
sound
without
errors
active
in
all
that
is
good
industrious
in
all
the
ways
in
which
good
is
to
be
gained

I
am
glad
you
find
a
want
of
that
ministry
you
did
enjoy
labour
to
keep
a
fresh
desire
after
the
sincere
milk
of
the
word
and
than
in
good
time
you
shall
enjoy
that
blessing
again

The
Lord
has
promised
to
give
his
spirit
to
his
children
which
shall
lead
them
in
the
truth

Beg
that
blessed
Spirit
and
than
errors
will
but
make
the
truth
more
bright
as
the
foil
does
a
diamond

My
dear
Ned
as
you
have
been
careful
to
choose
your
company
be
so
still
for
pitch
will
not
easily
be
touched
without
leaving
some
spot

I
had
not
heard
of
Duke
Roberts
and
my
Lord
Crauen’s
being
taken

I
hope
the
news
of
the
Swedes
is
not
true
but
in
all
these
things
we
must
remember
the
warning
which
our
Saviour
has
given
us
when
he
had
told
his
disciples
that
there
must
be
wars
and
rumours
of
wars
(
but
he
says
let
not
your
hearts
be
troubled
in
my
apprehension
as
if
Christ
had
said
great
troubles
and
wars
must
be
both
to
purge
his
church
of
hypocrites
and
that
his
enemies
at
the
last
may
be
utterly
destroyed
but
you
my
servants
be
not
careful
for
yourselves
you
are
my
jewels
and
the
days
of
trouble
are
the
days
when
I
take
care
of
jewels
and
my
dear
Ned
though
I
firmly
believe
there
will
be
great
troubles
yet
I
look
with
joy
beyond
those
days
of
trouble
considering
the
glory
that
the
Lord
will
bring
his
church
to
and
happy
are
they
that
shall
live
to
see
it
which
I
hope
you
will
do

There
is
lately
come
to
the
court
a
fresh
duke
with
two
or
three
other
gentlemen
or
noble
men
being
fled
from
the
French
king's
army
for
some
unfitting
words
they
used
of
the
French
king

The
Queen
mother
was
so
transported
with
joy
as
they
say
at
the
sight
of
the
queen
that
she
was
in
a
trance

This
day
I
heard
it
confirmed
from
London
that
the
Palsgrave
in
beseeching
a
town
in
Westfalia
was
raised
and
most
of
his
army
defeated
and
his
brother
taken
prisoner
but
this
is
our
comfort
that
the
rod
of
the
wicked
shall
not
always
rest
on
God’s
people

I
have
sent
Hall
purposely
to
see
you
for
since
I
cannot
speak
with
you
nor
see
you
so
often
as
I
desire
I
am
willing
to
make
these
paper
messengers
my
deputy

I
hope
I
shall
hear
from
you
by
this
messenger
I
thank
God
your
father
is
well
and
your
brother
Robert
has
had
no
fit
since
you
went

He
goes
to
school
and
eats
his
meat
well
and
I
hope
the
Lord
will
spare
him

You
must
write
to
him
you
know
he
is
apt
to
apprehend
unkindness

When
you
write
by
the
carrier
write
nothing
but
what
any
may
see
for
many
times
the
letters
miscarry

I
beseech
the
Lord
to
bless
you
as
I
desire
my
own
soul
should
be
blessed

affectionate

DEAR
COUSIN
Ely
13th
October
1638

I
thankfully
acknowledge
your
love
in
your
kind
remembrance
of
me
upon
this
opportunity

Alas
you
do
too
highly
prize
my
lines
and
my
company
I
may
be
ashamed
to
own
your
expressions
considering
how
unprofitable
I
am
and
the
mean
improvement
of
my
talent

Yet
to
honour
my
God
by
declaring
what
He
has
done
for
my
soul
in
this
I
am
confident
and
I
will
be
so

Though
He
does
prolong
yet
He
will
I
trust
bring
me
to
His
tabernacle
to
His
resting-place

My
soul
is
with
the
congregation
of
the
firstborn
my
body
rests
in
hope
and
if
here
I
may
honour
my
God
either
by
doing
or
by
suffering
I
shall
be
most
glad

Truly
no
poor
creature
has
more
cause
to
put
himself
forth
in
the
cause
of
his
God
than
I

I
have
had
plentiful
wages
beforehand
and
I
am
sure
I
shall
never
earn
the
least
mite

The
Lord
accept
me
in
His
Son
and
give
me
to
walk
in
the
light
and
give
us
to
walk
in
the
light
as
He
is
the
light

He
it
is
that
enlightens
our
blackness
our
darkness

I
dare
not
say
He
hides
His
face
from
me

He
gives
me
to
see
light
in
His
light

Oh
I
lived
in
and
loved
darkness
and
hated
light
I
was
a
chief
the
chief
of
sinners

This
is
true
I
hated
godliness
yet
God
had
mercy
on
me

O
the
riches
of
His
mercy

begun
a
good
work
would
perfect
it
in
the
day
of
Christ

Salute
all
my
friends
in
that
family
whereof
you
are
yet
a
member

I
am
much
bound
unto
them
for
their
love

I
bless
the
Lord
for
them
and
that
my
son
by
their
procurement
is
so
well

Let
him
have
your
prayers
your
counsel
let
me
have
them

Once
more
farewell

The
Lord
be
with
you
so
prays
Your
truly
loving
cousin
OLIVER
CROMWELL

Master
Nicholas
I
have
received

from
the
King
who
writes
to
me
he
as
been
very
well
received
in
Scotland

that
both
the
army

the
people
have
showed
a
great
joy
to
see
the
King
and
such
that
they
say
was
never
seen
before

god
it
may
continued

The
Q
for
me
to
signify
to
Lord
Chamberlain

DEAR
SISTER
THE
earnest
desire
I
have
to
hear
of
your
health
makes
me
endeavour
to
find
out
the
securest
means
that
these
lines
may
come
with
safety
into
your
hands
the
times
affording
me
so
convenient
an
opportunity
by
the
occasion
of
my
niece
Cornwallis
being
here
whose
society
is
so
exceeding
good
that
were
it
not
prejudicial
to
hear
that
I
so
much
love
and
honour
I
wish
I
might
always
enjoy
the
happiness
of
so
deserving
a
friend
but
this
age
of
mutility
permits
us
no
certainty
of
comfort
long
and
therefore
with
patience
I
must
condescend
to
what
is
determined
by
the
greater
Power

My
nephew
Bacon
is
very
well
and
is
pleased
some
times
to
come
and
visit
his
uncle
and
me

I
should
take
it
very
well
if
you
would
spare
so
much
time
as
to
write
to
me
I
have
recommended
divers
letters
unto
you
since
I
received
those
monies
which
was
due
at
Christmas
last
and
likewise
acknowledging
my
self
much
engaged
to
you
for
your
gift
you
was
pleased
to
send
me
and
with
God's
permission
I
will
not
desist
in
my
prayers
that
He
would
restore
it
again
to
you
and
yours
the
good
that
you
are
pleased
to
do
to
me
and
mine

Now
I
desire
you
dear
Sister
that
monies
which
will
be
due
at
Midsummer
next
you
will
be
pleased
to
give
order
to
him
that
you
shall
command
that
I
may
receive
it
against
the
day
in
that
Mister
Meautys
has
disposed
of
those
monies
to
my
use
and
my
children's
and
that
those
monies
may
be
returned
unto
me
according
to
that
rate
that
the
exchange
is
now
at
and
by
the
same
party
that

MR

BARNARD
`Huntingdon,'

January
1642

It's
most
true
my
Lieutenant
with
some
other
soldiers
of
my
troop
were
at
your
house

I
dealt
‘so’
freely
‘as’
to
inquire
after
you
the
reason
was
I
had
heard
you
reported
active
against
the
proceedings
of
parliament
and
for
those
that
disturb
the
peace
of
this
country
and
the
kingdom
with
those
of
this
country
who
have
had
meetings
not
a
few
to
intents
and
purposes
tootoo
full
of
suspect

It's
true
Sir
I
know
you
have
been
wary
in
your
carriages
be
not
too
confident
thereof

Subtlety
may
deceive
you
integrity
never
will

With
my
heart
I
shall
desire
that
your
judgement
may
alter
and
your
practice

I
come
only
to
hinder
men
from
increasing
the
rent
from
doing
hurt
but
not
to
hurt
any
man
nor
shall
I
you
I
hope
you
will
give
me
no
cause

Be
assured
fair
words
from
me
shall
neither
deceive
you
of
your
houses
nor
of
your
liberty

all
and
every
inhabitants
of
Fen

the

WHEREAS
we
have
been
enforced
by
apparent
grounds
of
approaching
danger
to
begin
to
fortify
the
town
of
Cambridge
for
preventing
the
enemy's
inroad
and
the

to
maintain
the

this

Having
in

your
good

the

and
now
standing
in
need
of
your
further
assistance
to
the
perfecting
of
the
said
fortifications
which
will
cost
at
least
twothousand
pounds
we
are
encouraged
as
well
as
necessitated
to
desire
a
freewill
offering
of
a
liberal
contribution

the

therefore
desire
that
what

be
by
you
freely
given
and
collected
may
with
all
convenient
speed
be
sent
to
the
commissioners
at
Cambridge
to
be
employed
to
the
use
aforesaid

And
so
you
shall
further
engage
us
to
be

I
am
sorry
I
should
so
often
trouble
you
about
the
business
of
money
it's
no
pleasant
subject
to
be
too
frequent
upon

But
such
is
Captain
Nelson's
occasion
for
want
thereof
that
he
has
not
wherewith
to
satisfy
for
the
billet
of
his
soldiers
and
so
this
business
for
Norfolk
so
hopeful
to
set
all
right
there
may
fail

Truly
he
has
borrowed
from
me
else
he
could
not
have
paid
to
discharge
this
town
at
his
departure

It's
a
pity
a
gentleman
of
his
affections
should
be
discouraged

Wherefore
I
earnestly
beseech
you
to
consider
him
and
the
cause

It's
honourable
that
you
do
so

What
you
can
help
to
be
pleased
to
send
into
Norfolk
he
has
not
wherewith
to
pay
a
troop
one
day

he
tells
me

Let
your
return
be

Gentlemen
'Cambridge,'
23rd
March
1642

Upon
the
coming
down
of
your
townsmen
to
Cambridge
Captain
Langley
not
knowing
how
to
dispose
of
them
desired
me
to
nominate
a
fit
captain
which
I
did
an
honest
religious
valiant
Gentleman
Captain
Dodsworth
the
bearer
hereof

He
has
diligently
attended
the
service
and
much
improved
his
men
in
their
exercise
but
has
been
unhappy
beyond
others
in
not
receiving
any
pay
for
himself
and
what
he
had
for
his
soldiers
is
out
long
ago

He
has
by
his
prudence
what
with
fair
and
winning
carriage
what
with
money
borrowed
kept
them
together

He
is
able
to
do
so
no
longer
they
will
presently
disband
if
a
course
be
not
taken

It's
a
pity
it
should
be
so

For
I
believe
they
are
brought
into
as
good
order
as
most
companies
in
the
army

Besides
at
this
instant
there
is
great
need
to
use
them
I
have
received
a
special
command
from
my
Lord
General
to
advance
with
what
force
we
can
to
put
an
end
if
it
may
be
to
this
work
God
so
assisting
from
whom
all
help
comes

one
month's
pay
may
prove
all
your
trouble

I
speak
to
wise
men
God
direct
you

I
rest

I
have
been
now
two
days
at
Cambridge
in
expectation
to
hear
the
fruit
of
your
endeavours
in
Suffolk
towards
the
public
assistance

Believe
it
you
will
hear
of
a
storm
in
few
days

You
have
no
infantry
at
all
considerable
hasten
your
horses
a
few
hours
may
undo
you
neglected

I
beseech
you
be
careful
what
captains
of
horse
you
choose
what
men
be
mounted
a
few
honest
men
are
better
than
numbers

The
King
is
exceeding
strong
in
the
West

If
you
be
able
to
foil
a
force
at
the
first
coming
of
it
you
will
have
reputation
and
that
is
of
great
advantage
in
our
affairs

God
has
given
it
to
our
handful
let
us
endeavour
to
keep
it

I
had
rather
have
a
plain
russetcoated
captain
that
knows
what
he
fights
for
and
loves
what
he
knows
than
that
which
you
call
"
a
gentleman
and
is
nothing
else

I
honour
a
gentleman
I
understand
Mr.
Margery
has
honest
men
will
follow
him
if
so
be
pleased
to
make
use
of
him
it
much
concerns
your
good
to
have
conscientious
men

I
understand
that
there
is
an
order
for
me
to
have
3000
out
of
the
association
and
Essex
has
sent
their
part
or
near
it

I
assure
you
we
need
exceedingly

I
hope
to
find
your
favour
and
respect

P.S

If
you
send
such
men
as
Essex
has
sent
it
will
be
to
little
purpose

Be
pleased
to
take
care
of
their
march
and
that
such
may
come
along
with
them
as
will
be
able
to
bring
them
to
the
main
body
and
than
I
doubt
not
but
we
shall
keep
them

make
good
use
of
them

I

Mr.

Help
him

beyond

Many
of
my

are
come

me
very
to
a
week
almost

the

My
troops
increase

I
have
a
lovely
company
you
would
respect
them
did
you
know
them

They
are
no
"
Anabaptists
they
are
honest
sober
Christians
they
expect
to
be
used
as

I
took
pleasure

bitterness
I
have
occasion

'Of'
the
3,000
pounds
allotted

cannot
get
the
Norfolk

the
Hertfordshire
it
was
gone
before
I
had

I
have
minded
your

forgetfulness

my

I
desire
not
to
seek
myself
but
I
have
little
money

my
own

help
my

You
have
had
my
money
I
hope
in

I
desire

venture
my

So
do
mine

Lay
weight
upon

break
it
not

of
that
which
may
be
a
real

I
believe
5,000

is
due

To
his
honoured
friends
Sir
William
Spring
and
Mr.
Barrow
These
present

Gentlemen
'Holland
Lincolnshire,'
28th
September
1643

It
has
pleased
God
to
bring
off
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
his
horse
over
the
river
from
Hull
being
about
onetwenty
troops
of
horse
and
Dragoons

The
Lincolnshire
horse
laboured
to
hinder
this
work
being
about
thirtyfour
colours
of
horse
and
dragoons
we
marched
up
to
their
landingplace
and
the
Lincolnshire
horse
retreated

After
they
were
come
over
we
all
marched
towards
Holland
and
when
we
came
to
our
last
quarter
upon
the
edge
of
Holland
the
enemy
quartered
within
four
miles
of
us
and
kept
the
field
all
night
with
his
whole
body
his
intentment
as
we
conceive
was
to
fight
us
or
hoping
to
interpose
betwixt
us
and
our
retreat
having
received
to
his
thirtyfour
colours
of
horse
twenty
fresh
troops
ten
companies
of
'Dragoons;'
and
about
a
thousand
foot
being
general
King's
own
regiment

With
these
he
attempted
our
guards
and
our
quarters
and
if
God
had
not
been
merciful
had
ruined
us
before
we
had
known
of
it
the
five
troops
we
set
to
keep
the
watch
failing
much
of
their
duty

I
write
unto
you
to
acquaint
you
with
this
the
rather
that
God
may
be
acknowledged
and
that
you
may
help
forward
in
sending
such
force
away
unto
us
as
lie
unprofitably
in
your
country

And
especially
that
troop
of
Captain
Margery's
which
surely
would
not
be
wanting
now
we
so
much
need
it

I
hear
there
has
been
much
exception
taken
to
Captain
Margery
and
his
officers
for
taking
of
horses

I
am
sorry
you
should
discountenance
those
who
(
not
to
make
benefit
to
themselves
but
to
serve
their
country
are
willing
to
venture
their
lives
and
to
purchase
to
themselves
the
displeasure
of
bad
men
that
they
may
do
a
public
benefit

I
undertake
not
to
justify
all
Captain
Margery's
actions
but
his
own
conscience
knows
whether
he
has
taken
the
horses
of
any
but
malignants
and
it
were
somewhat
too
hard
to
put
it
upon
the
consciences
of
your
fellow
deputy
lieutenants
whether
they
have
not
freed
the
horses
of
known
malignants

A
fault
not
less
considering
the
sad
estate
of
this
kingdom
than
to
take
a
horse
from
a
known
honest
man
the
offence
being
against
the
public
which
is
a
considerable
aggravation

I
know
not
the
measures
everyone
takes
of
malignants

I
think
it
is
not
fit
Captain
Margery
should
be
the
judge
but
if
he
in
his
taking
of
horses
has
observed
the
plain
character
of
a
malignant
and
cannot
be
charged
for
one
horse
otherwise
taken
it
had
been
better
that
some
of
the
bitterness
wherewith
he
and
his
have
been
followed
had
been
spared

I'll
bid
them
welcome

And
when
they
have
fought
for
you
and
endured
some
other
difficulties
of
war
which
your
"
honest
men
will
hardly
bear
I
pray
you
than
let
them
go
for
honest
men

I
protest
unto
you
many
of
those
men
which
are
of
your
country’s
choosing
under
Captain
Johnson
are
so
far
from
serving
you
that
were
it
not
that
I
have
honest
troops
to
master
them
although
they
be
well
paid
yet
they
are
so
mutinous
that
I
may
justly
fear
they
would
cut
my
throat

--
Gentlemen
it
may
be
it
provokes
some
spirits
to
see
such
plain
men
made
captains
of
horse

It
had
been
well
that
men
of
honour
but
why
do
they
not
appear

Who
would
have
hindered
them

But
seeing
it
was
necessary
the
work
must
go
on
better
plain
men
than
none
but
best
to
have
men
patient
of
wants
faithful
and
conscientious
in
their
employment

And
such
I
hope
these
will
approve
themselves
to
be

And
I
believe
before
it
be
long
you
will
be
in
their
debt
and
than
it
will
not
be
hard
to
quit
scores

What
arms
you
can
furnish
them
withal
I
beseech
you
do
it

I
have
hitherto
found
your
kindness
great
to
me
I
know
not
what
I
have
done
to
lose
it
I
love
it
so
well
and
price
it
so
high
that
I
would
do
my
best
to
gain
more

You
have
the
assured
affection
of
Your
most
humble
and
faithful
servant
OLIVER
CROMWELL

P.S

I
understand
there
were
some
exceptions
taken
at
a
horse
that
was
sent
to
me
which
was
seized
out
of
the
hands
of
one
Mr.
Goldsmith
of
Wilby

If
he
be
not
by
you
judged
a
malignant
and
that
you
do
not
approve
of
my
having
of
the
horse
I
shall
as
willingly
return
him
again
as
you
shall
desire

And
therefore
I
pray
you
signify
your
pleasure
to
me
herein
under
your
hands

Or
if
he
be
unwilling
to
part
with
him
but
keeps
him
for
his
own
pleasure
be
pleased
to
send
me
an
answer
thereof
I
shall
instantly
return
him
his
horse
and
do
it
with
a
great
deal
more
satisfaction
to
myself
than
keep
him

Therefore
I
beg
it
of
you
to
satisfy
my
desire
in
this
last
request
it
shall
exceedingly
oblige
me
to
you

If
you
do
it
not
I
shall
rest
very
unsatisfied
and
the
horse
will
be
a
burden
to
me
so
long
as
I
shall
keep
him

SIR
The
complaints
you
preferred
to
my
lord
against
your
lieutenantcolonel
both
by
Mr.
Lee
and
your
own
letters
have
occasioned
his
stay
here
my
Lord
being
'so'
employed
in
regard
of
many
occasions
which
are
upon
him
that
he
has
not
been
at
leisure
to
hear
him
make
his
defence
which
in
pure
justice
ought
to
be
granted
him
or
any
man
before
a
judgement
be
passed
upon
him

During
his
abode
here
and
absence
from
you
he
has
acquainted
me
what
a
grief
it
is
to
him
to
be
absent
from
his
charge
especially
now
the
regiment
is
called
forth
to
action
and
therefore
asking
of
me
my
opinion
I
advised
him
speedily
to
repair
unto
you

Surely
you
are
not
well
advised
thus
to
turn
off
one
so
faithful
to
the
cause
and
so
able
to
serve
you
as
this
man
is

Give
me
leave
to
tell
you
I
cannot
be
of
your
judgement
'cannot
understand
if
a
man
notorious
for
wickedness
for
oaths
for
drinking
has
as
great
a
share
in
your
affection
as
one
who
fears
an
oath
who
fears
to
sin
that
this
does
commend
your
election
ay
but
the
man
"
is
an
Anabaptist

Are
you
sure
of
that

It
may
be
so
in
some
things
we
have
all
human
infirmities

I
tell
you
if
you
had
none
but
such
"
indiscreet
men
about
you
and
would
be
pleased
to
use
them
kindly
you
would
find
as
good
a
fence
to
you
as
any
you
have
yet
chosen

Sir
the
state
in
choosing
men
to
serve
it
takes
no
notice
of
their
opinions
if
they
be
willing
faithfully
to
serve
it
that
satisfies

I
advised
you
formerly
to
bear
with
men
of
different
minds
from
yourself
if
you
had
done
it
when
I
advised
you
to
it
I
think
you
would
not
have
had
so
many
stumblingblocks
in
your
way

It
may
be
you
judge
otherwise
but
I
tell
you
my
mind

I
desire
you
would
receive
this
man
into
your
favour
and
opinion

I
believe
if
he
follow
my
counsel
he
will
deserve
no
other
but
respect
from
you

Take
heed
of
being
sharp
or
too
easily
sharpened
by
others
against
those
to
whom
you
can
object
little
but
that
they
square
not
with
you
in
every
opinion
concerning
matters
of
religion

I
question
whether
you
or
I
have
any
precedent
for
that

I
have
no
further
to
trouble
you
but
rest

humble

Sir

17th
April
1643

I
have
received
two
letters
one
from
my
lord
of
Manchester
the
other
from
yourself
much
to
the

effect
I
hope
therefore
one
answer
will
serve
them
both

Which
is
in
short
this
what
we
know
you
are
disaffected
to
the
parliament
and
truly
if
the
Lords
or
any
friends
may
take
you
off
from

MY
LORDS
AND
GENTELEMEN
'Lincolnshire,'
3rd
May
1643

I
must
needs
be
hardly
thought
on
because
I
am
still
the
messenger
of
unhappy
tidings
and
delays
concerning
you
though
I
know
my
heart
is
to
assist
you
with
all
expedition

My
Lord
Grey
has
now
again
failed
me
of
the
rendezvous
at
Stamford
notwithstanding
that
both
he
and
I
received
letters
from
his
Excellency
commanding
us
both
to
meet
and
together
with
Sir
John
Gell
and
the
Nottingham
forces
to
join
with
you

My
Lord
Grey
sent
Sir
Edward
Hartop
to
me
to
let
me
know
he
could
not
meet
me
at
Stamford
according
to
our
agreement
fearing
the
exposing
of
Leicester
to
the
forces
of
Mr.
Hastings
and
some
other
troops
drawing
the
way

Believe
it
it
were
better
in
my
poor
opinion
Leicester
were
not
than
that
there
should
not
be
found
an
immediate
taking
of
the
field
by
our
forces
to
accomplish
the
common
ends

Wherein
I
shall
deal
as
freely
with
him
when
I
meet
him
as
you
can
desire

I
perceive
AshbyZouch
sticks
much
with
him

And
than
you
shall
receive
full
satisfaction
concerning
my
integrity
and
if
no
man
shall
help
you
yet
will
not
I
be
wanting
to
do
my
duty
God
assisting
me

If
we
could
unite
those
forces
'of
theirs;'
and
with
them
speedily
make
Grantham
the
general
rendezvous
both
of
yours
and
ours
I
think
it
would
do
well

I
shall
bend
my
endeavours
that
way

Your
concurrence
by
some
able
instrument
to
solicit
this
might
probably
exceedingly
hasten
it
especially
having
so
good
a
foundation
to
work
upon
as
my
Lord
General's
commands

Our
Norfolk
forces
which
will
not
prove
so
many
as
you
may
imagine
by
six
or
seven
hundred
men
will
lie
conveniently
at
Spalding
and
I
am
confident
be
ready
to
meet
at
Grantham
at
the
general
rendezvous

I
have
no
more
to
trouble
you
but
begging
of
God
to
take
away
the
impediments
that
hinder
our
conjunction

to
prosper
our
designs


For
my
noble
friends
the
Committee
for
the
Isle
of
Ely
present
these

I
have
given
order
to
Captain
Husband
to
see
them
recommitted
to
the
hands
of
my
Marshal
Richard
White

And
I
much
desire
you
for
the
future
not
to
entrench
upon
me
so
much
as
to
release
them
or
any
committed
in
the
like
case
by
myself
or
my
deputy
and
commanders
in
the
garrison
-
until
myself
or
some
superior
authority
be
satisfied
in
the
cause
and
do
give
order
in
allowance
of
their
enlargement

For
I
profess
I
will
be
no
governor
nor
engage
any
other
under
me
to
undertake
such
a
charge
upon
such
I
am
so
sensible
of
the
need
we
have
to
improve
the
present
opportunity
of
our
being
masters
of
the
field
and
having
no
enemy
near
the
Isle
and
to
spare
whatever
charge
we
can
towards
the
making
of
those
fortifications
which
may
render
it
more
defensible
hereafter
if
we
shall
have
more
need
I
shall
desire
you
for
that
end
to
ease
the
isle
and
treasury
from
the
superfluous
charge
of
'having'
two
several
committees
for
the
several
parts
of
the
Isle
and
that
one
committee
settled
at
March
may
serve
for
the
whole
Isle

Wherefore
I
wish
that
one
of
your
number
may
in
your
courses
intend
and
appear
at
that
committee
to
manage
and
uphold
it
the
better
for
all
parts
of
the
Isle

Resting
upon
your
care
herein
I
remain
Your
friend
to
serve
you
OLIVER
CROMWELL

DEAR
SISTER
ALTHOUGH
I
cannot
be
so
happy
to
receive
your
lines
yet
your
kind
remembrance
has
not
failed
to
give
me
an
assured
testimony
of
your
firm
and
considerable
affection
in
condescending
unto
my
request
coming
in
a
time
so
acceptable
that
had
it
not
been
I
and
mine
had
not
had
where
withal
to
have
subsisted
therefore
think
that
they
have
relieved
so
many
dying
souls
which
had
suffered
had
not
God
ordained
you
to
be
the
means
of
our
preservation

To
this
day
my
husband
is
still
at
Arnheim
and
is
so
miserably
entreated
by
their
injustice
that
in
this
space
of
a
year
he
has
not
been
able
to
send
me
any
money
or
to
come
unto
me
and
through
his
heavy
troubles
and
wants
he
is
grown
very
sickly
and
has
of
late
been
so
extreme/extremely
ill
that
those
that
were
near
him
was
doubtful
of
his
recovery
and
although
it
is
in
these
parts
ill
travelling
in
the
winter
season
yet
I
do
intend
to
go
and
see
him
and
to
leave
my
children
at
my
house
in
the
Hague
until
my
return
for
there
is
no
venturing
to
take
them
with
me
but
my
resolution
is
to
come
suddenly
back
again

Thus
with
my
prayers
unto
the
Almighty
to
preserve
you
and
all
yours
in
these
dangerous
times
from
all
calamities
I
commit
you
unto
His
protection
and
rest
Your
most
affectionate
sister
to
my
end
ANNA
MEAUTYS

Right
Worshipful
I
could
not
oversleep
those
kind
respects
and
fair
expressions
you
pleased
to
show
towards
me
in
Mr.
Smith’s
letter
without
the
return
of
a
few
gratulatory
lines

The
presentment
whereof
I
cannot
count
a
piece
of
presumption
since
you
laid
me
the
foundation
to
work
upon
I
cannot
but
really
thank
you
for
the
communication
of
your
opinion
I
shall
trace
your
directions
by
which
means
I
question
not
but
I
shall
attain
to
the
utmost
of
my
desires

My
years
in
the
university
are
shot
up
to
a
middle
bachelorship
which
height
of
a
graduate
I
am
sure
ought
to
speak
him
ineffective
in
any
part
of
philosophy

Our
second
year
of
sophistry
is
always
taken
up
in
physical
contemplation
(
without
perfect
knowledge
whereof
no
clear
passage
is
granted
to
any
in
the
commencement
house
and
I
hope
no
material
piece
than
passed
my
eye
an
extract
whereof
is
not
remnant
in
my
present
self

Yet
I
shall
(
submitting
to
your
mature
judgement
review
the
whole
body
of
philosophy
especially
natural

The
pleasantness
of
which
science
(
had
not
your
desires
concurred
might
have
reinvited
me
to
that
study

I
intended
to
have
seen
Cambridge
a
month
since
but
some
intervening
accidents
still
quashed
my
journey
and
now
you
know
that
supernatural
cause
which
prolongs
my
stay
here

I
hope
the
heaviness
of
that
hand
will
shortly
be
removed
and
our
college
repupilled
and
than
(
god
willing
I
will
increase

into

Our

furnish
you
with
very
small
news
only
the
death

some

your

your

will
permit
the

of
a
few
lines

The
subject
of
my
last
letter
being
so
high
and
noble
a
piece
of
chemistry
viz
the
re-individualling
of
an
incinerated
plant
invites
me
once
more
to
request
an
experimental
eviction
of
it
from
your
self
and
I
hope
you
will
not
chide
my
importunity
in
this
petition
or
be
angry
at
my
so
frequent
knockings
at
your
door
to
obtain
a
grant
of
so
great
and
admirable
a
mystery

It is
not
only
an
ocular
demonstration
of
our
resurrection
but
a
notable
illustration
of
that
psychopannychy
which
antiquity
so
generally
received
how
these
forms
of
ours
may
be
lulled
and
lie
asleep
after
the
separation
(
closed
up
in
their
Ubi's
by
a
surer
than
Hermes
his
seal
until
that
great
and
general
day
when
by
the
help
of
that
gentle
heat
which
in
six
days
hatched
the
world
by
a
higher
chemistry
it
shall
be
resuscitated
into
its
former
self
suamque
Arborem
Inversam
in
continuo
esse
et
operari
iterata
præservabit

The
secret
is
so
noble
and
admirable
that
it
has
invited
my
enquiries
into
divers
authors
and
chemical
tractates
amongst
which
Quercitan
and
Angelus
Salae
give
some
little
hint
thereof
but
so
obscurely
and
imperfectly
that
I
have
no
more
hopes
to
be
ocularly
convinced
through
their
prescriptions
than
to
be
experimentally
confirmed
that
the
species
of
an
incinerated
animal
may
be
encasked
in
a
piece
of
winter
crystal
as
some
other
mineralists
confidently
affirm

Alsted
I
confess
in
his
pyrotechnic
more
clearly
describes
the
matter
but
the
manner
of
experimenting
it
he
utterly
leaves
unmentioned

Therefore
my
only
address
is
to
you
hoping
to
find
as
much
willingness
to
communicate
as
ability
to
evince
the
certainty
of
this
secret
to
The
most
engaged
of
your
friends
Henry
Power
Ch

Sir
This
enclosed
is
from
a
worthy
friend
of
mine
who
has
made
bold
upon
my
incitement
to
enwrap
a
few
lines
to
you
if
you
please
to
repay
us
both
but
with
one
single
answer
it
will
not
only
evince
us
of
your
fair
acceptance
of
them
but
shall
also
challenge
a
double
gratulatory
as
a
due
debt
in
counterpoise
and
recompense
thereof

To
the
right
worshipful
his
honoured
friend
Thomas
Brown
Dr
of
Physic
in
Norwich
these
Right
Worshipful
I
cannot
but
return
you
infinite
thanks
for
your
excessive
pains
in
doubling
of
your
last
letter
to
me
both
pages
whereof
were
so
exceeding
satisfactory
to
my
requests
as
that
I
know
not
whether
of
them
may
more
justly
challenge
a
larger
return
of
thanks
from
me

For
the
fore-page
I
have
traced
your
commands
and
simpled
in
the
woods
meadows
and
fields
instead
of
gardens
which
being
obvious
and
in
every
country
I
may
easily
hereafter
be
made
a
garden
herbalist
by
any
sheempiric

I
have
both
Gerard
with
Johnson's
addition
and
Parkinson
the
former
has
the
clearer
cut
and
outvies
the
other
in
an
accurate
description
of
a
plant
the
latter
is
the
better
methodist
and
has
bedded
his
plants
in
a
better
rank
and
order

I
compared
also
Dodonæus
with
them
who
does
very
well
for
a
short
and
curt
herbalist
yet
I
shall
embrace
Gerard
above
all
because
you
pleased
to
honour
him
with
your
approbation

For
the
backside
of
your
letter
I
am
extremely
satisfied
in
your
resolves
of
my
quire

I
confess
I
run
into
too
deep
a
belief
and
too
strong
a
concept
of
chemistry
(
yet
not
beyond
what
some
of
those
artists
affirm
of
the
reproduction
of
the
same
plant
by
ordinary
way
of
vegetation
for
(
say
they
if
the
salt
be
taken
and
transferred
to
another
country
and
there
sowed
the
plant
thereof
shall
sprout
out
even
from
common
earth

But
it
will
be
satisfaction
enough
to
the
greatest
of
my
desires
to
behold
the
leaves
thereof
shadowed
in
glaciation
of
which
experiment
I
hope
shall
have
the
happiness
to
be
ocularly
evinced
at
some
opportunity
by
you

But
I
shall
determine
of
nothing
till
I
see
you
here
in
which
journey
I
could
wish
(
were
it
not
to
the
disadvantage
of
your
affairs
you
would
prevent
our
expectations

Sir
I
have
now
by
the
frequency
of
living
and
dead
dissections
of
dogs
run
through
the
whole
body
of
anatomy
insisting
upon
Spigelius
Bartholinus
Fernelius
Columbus
Veslingius
but
especially
Harvey's
circulation
and
the
two
incomparable
authors
Descartes
and
Regius
which
indeed
were
the
only
two
that
answered
my
doubts
and
quires
in
that
art

I
have
likewise
made
some
little
proficiency
in
herbary
and
by
going
out
3
or
4
miles
once
a
week
have
brought
home
with
me
2
or
3
hundred
herbs

I
have
likewise
run
through
Heurnius
which
I
very
well
allow
of
for
a
Peripathetical
author

He
is
something
curt
de
urina
which
I
conceive
to
be
a
very
necessary
piece
in
physic
now
the
circulation
is
discovered
for
since
the
urine
is
channelled
all
along
with
the
blood
through
almost
all
the
Parenchymata
of
the
body
before
it
come
to
the
kidneys
to
be
strained
and
separated
it
must
needs
carry
a
tincture
of
any
disaffected
or
diseased
part
through
which
it
passes

For
Senertus
I
cannot
yet
procure
him
but
'it is
said
he’s
coming
out
in
a
new
letter

than
I
question
not

I
shall
have
him

Mr.
Smith

his
humble

may

it

more
nobly

will

Mr
Secretary
I
have
received
yours
of
the
18th
of
this
month

I
long
to
hear
my
sweet
nephew
is
at
Brussels

My
niece
has
sent
Nick
Armourer
to
meet
him
there

I
have
written
to
him
by
him
if
the
King
would
permit
him
to
take
this
place
and
tailing
in
his
way
from
Brussels
he
would
make
his
sister
and
me
very
glad
he
need
not
make
such
haste
to
see
him
it
is
but
the
other
day
since
he
was
with
him
but
it
is
much
longer
since
wee
saw
him
and
I
am
sure
our
hoghen
Moghens
will
take
no
notice
of
it
if
they
be
not
asked
the
question
as
they
were
for
the
King's
coming
to
Breda

To
be
with
his
sister
some
time
can
do
him
no
harm

The
French
Ambassador
believes
the
treaty
with
Cromwell
as
good
as
broken
he
is
much
joined
that
the
meeting
between
the
Queen
of
Sueden
and
P

of
Condé
was
to
neither
of
their
content
for
he
desired
to
be
received
as
the
Queen
received
the
Archduke
which
she
refused
saying
she
had
done
too
much
in
that
and
would
do
so
no
more
yet
he
came
to
see
her
brusguement
a
improvise
and
did
nothing
but
rely
her
in
his
talk
which
put
her
so
out
as
she
said
almost
not
one
word

This
was
in
the
morning
after
dinner
she
sent
to
know
if
he
would
see
the
play
at
night
he
said
he
would
obey
her
but
desired
to
know
whither
he
should
come
know
or
as
unknown
for
if
he
came
as
Prince
of
Condé
he
looked
to
have
a
chaise
a
bras
as
the
Archduke
had—she
said
he
had
better
come
unknown
so
he
came
and
she
stood
all
the
play
railing
with
Monsieur
Quito
the
Princes
favourite

The
next
day
the
P

went
to
Brussels
and
neither
of
them
well
satisfied
with
the
other

My

be

Mr.
Secretary
since
you
wrote
yours
I
understand
that
that
arch
villain
Manning
has
received
his
just
desert

I
wish
all
those
of
his
cabal
with
him

I
wish
I
might
know
whom
he
has
accused
on
this
side
the
sea
to
avoid
them
but
this
is
only
in
case
you
may
tell
it
for
I
do
not
desire
it
otherwise
I
have
curiosity
enough
to
desire
or
know
the
rest
but
I
will
not
desire
but
as
you
think
fit

It
is
believed
that
Prince
William
will
be
shortly
marshal
of
the
field
those
that
were
so
much
against
him
are
not
now
so
fierce
else
there
is
no
news
only
Scone
is
come
and
I
hope
all
will
be
well
ended
in
that
foolish
business

I
am
ever
Your
most
affectionate
friend

Mr.
Charles
Cottrell
my
Lord
Wentworth
and
reverend
Dick
Harding
I
cannot
write
to
them
now
for
lack
of
time

I
pray
tell
the
same
to
Monsieur
Soiret
from
me

Mr.
Secretary
I
am
very
glad
to
find
by
your
letter
that
you
are
safely
arrived
and
all
your
company
at
Aix
and
that
you
found
the
King
and
my
Niece
so
well
in
health
and
so
kind
one
to
the
other
which
has
ever
been
so
since
I
have
known
them

I
believe
indeed
the
separation
will
be
hard
but
when
there
is
no
remedy
one
must
be
content

As
for
my
journey
up
hill
I
cannot
tell
what
to
say
to
it
Sir
Charles
Cottrell
shall
inform
you
how
it
goes
but
slowly
on
and
which
is
stranger
that
it
is
not
my
fault

Dr.
Morley
has
made
a
very
good
description
of
the
Queen
of
Sweden
she
gave
an
assignation
to
the
French
Ambassador
to
meet
her
at
Breda
whither
he
went
and
so
did
the
Prince
and
Princess
of
Tarente
and
most
of
our
French
gallants
who
came
all
sneaking
home
again
for
her
grief
was
so
great
for
the
beating
of
the
Spanish
army
before
Arras
as
she
would
not
go
to
Breda

I
long
to
hear
what
part
my
godson
had
in
it
for
I
still
think
of
him
being
my
cheefest
comfort
next
your
excellent
Master

I
am
very
glad
your
daughter
is
so
well
I
do
not
wonder
at
it
she
is
so
well
used
and
now

I
thank
you
for
yours
of
the
18th
of
September

Yesterday
I
was
told
that
all
the
people
at
Brussels
were
sending
their
goods
to
Antwerp
for
fear
of
the

Boswell

well
enough

but
I

him
for
he
is

undone

is

no

all

but

by

Mr.

I
am
very
glad
that
I
shall

my

here
so
soon
and
I
thank
you
for
all
your
other
news

I
believe
Dr.
Morley
will
write
those
that
he
hears
out
of
England
of
Cromwell’s
dissolving
of
his
parliament
for
being
so
ungracious
as
not
to
do
as
he
would
have
them

It
was
confirmed
to
me
the
last
night
by
one
of
the
States
general
for
three
of
their
deputies
is
come
from
London
that
were
sent
about
the
treaty
of
the
ambassadors
and
the
other
disputes
they
confirm
all
but
it
was
so
late
that
I
could
not
hear
of
the
particulars

The
same
state
told
me
there
was
a
speech
of
part
of
the
orange
and
red
men
in
rebellion
against
his
precious
highness

I
hear
there
is
one
that
has
heretofore
served
my
Lord
of
Branford
packed
from
Scotland
to
the
king
but
three
days
gone
and
came
from
thence
but
six
days
before
he
would
tell
no
news
but
made
hast
away

Soon
as
he
went
there
reached
here
one
Thomson
one
I
have
seen
before
he
tells
all
the
particulars
of
the
defeat
that
is
so
bragged
of

He
said
that
they
were
dispersed
upon
it
but
it
as
above
five
weeks
since
he
came
from
thence
being
come
thorough
England
by
his
country
the
borders
where
in
his
passage
he
met
with
a
party
where
he
was
hurt
and
lamed
but
for
all
that
he
is
gone
to
the
king

He
much
complains
of
divisions
amongst
them
and
not
of
Sir
George
Monroe
which
they
do
also

I
do
admire
how
people
could
tell
so
great
a
lie
as
the
parquet
but
it
is
very
common
amongst
my
countrymen

to

and

very
freely
but
handsomely

My
Lady
Herbert
is
also
here

Sunday
I
have
had
yet
no

her
any

her

I

her
who
I
was
but
she
made
no
show
of
it

I
went
the
next
day
to
Brussels
where
I
saw
the
Archduke
at
mass
and
I
saw
his
pictures
and
lodgings

Yet
she
sent
Donoy
to
me
with
a
very
civil
message
that
she
was
sorry
she
could
not
use
that
civility
to
me
as
she
both
should
do
and
desired
hoping
that
one
day
we
might
meet
together
with
more
freedom
I
answered
her
as
civilly
as
I
could
and
now
when
I
went
from
Bergen
I
gave
Sir
Will
Swann
charge
to
make
her
a
complement
from
me

I
came
hither
upon
Tuesday
from
Bergen
where
I
was
extremely
well
entertained
by
the
Princess
of
Zolern
who
was
with
me
and
was
my
guide
all
the
journey
and
defrayed
me

Her
daughter
is
now
so
pretty
every
way
that
you
would
like
her
yet
better
than
ever
you
did
if
you
saw
her
she
is
much
grown
and
is
still
of
a
very
sweet
disposition
and
she
does
become
her
she
has
a
great
deal
of
wit
and
loves
our
nation
extremely
it
makes
me
think
of
your
wish
which
I
am
not
against

know

By
this

I
have
had
very
good

said
she
will
press
him
no
further
in
it
but
I
hope
the
king
will
not
trust
to
it
but
get
him
away
from
thence
which
will

her
journey

the
Queen

Mr.
Secretary
since
you
wrote
yours
I
understand
that
that
arch
villain
Manning
has
received
his
just
desert

I
wish
all
those
of
his
cabal
with
him

I
wish
I
might
know
whom
he
has
accused
on
this
side
the
sea
to
avoid
them
but
this
is
only
in
case
you
may
tell
it
for
I
do
not
desire
it
otherwise
I
have
curiosity
enough
to
desire
o
know
the
rest
but
I
will
not
desire
but
as
you
think
fit

There
is
little
news
here
the
King
of
Sueden
has
a
son
born
to
him
and
has
and
prospers
exceedingly

the
K.
of
Poland
is
in
Silesia
hunts
and
passes
his
time
with
little
care
of
any
thing
else
this
I
have
from
his
own
resident
but
I
fear
the
Elector
of
Brandenburg
will
be
in
a
ill
condition
if
he
do
not
make
an
agreement
with
the
King
of
Sueden

It
is
believed
that
Prince
William
will
be
shortly
Marshall
of
the
Field
those
that
were
so
much
against
him
are
not
now
so
fierce
else
there
is
no
news
only
Scone
is
come
and
I
hope
all
will
be
well
ended
in

foolish
business

Mr.
Secretary
I
have
received
yours
of
the
29th
at
my
return
upon
last
Thursday
from
Tailing
and
this
morning
I
have
letters
from
Brussels
who
tell
me
that
my
dear
nephew
the
D.
of
Gloucester
was
there
upon
New
Years
Eve
the
same
day
I
was
at
Tailing
but
when
he
came
thither
or
goes
from
thence
I
know
not

I
am
extremely
glad
the
king
permits
(
him
to
see
his
sister
and
me

I
hope
he
will
suffer
him
to
stay
some
time
with
my
dear
niece
it
will
be
a
great
contentment
to
her
and
no
hurt
to
him
and
as
long
as
there
is
nothing
told
to
the
States
of
him
they
will
take
no
notice
of
it
this
I
know
is
true

I
am
sorry
for
poor
Sir
Henry
de
Vic
for
let
the
match
break
or
go
on
it
is
every
way
ill
for
him
We
hear
no
certainty
here
how
the
French
treaty
with
the
rebels
in
England
goes
whither
it
breaks
or
peaces

I
am
very
sorry
for
the
Countess
of
Morton’s
death
I
pity
Sir
Thom

Berkley
but
most
her
children

The
Queen
of
Sueden
is
now
at
Brussels
where
she
was
received
in
great
state
I
believe
the
Archduke
wished
her
at
Antwerp
for
she
persecutes
him
very
close
with
her
company
for
you
know
he
is
a
very
modest
man

The
good
agent
is
very
unwilling
to
go
but
he
must
obey
his
master

Sure
Cromwell
is
the
beast
in
the
revelations
that
all
kings
and
nations
do
worship
I
wish
him
the
like
end
and
speedily
and
you

happy

Mr.
Secretary
I
believe
you
will
hear
at
Colleen
how
I
have
been
debauched
this
last
week
in
sitting
up
late
to
see
dancing

Maurice
were
gossips
the
states
general
I
mean
their
deputies
and
the
counsel
of
state
and
myself
and
Louise
were
as
guests
there

After
super
was
dancing
this
(
till
three
a
clock
my
little
nephew
was
at
the
super
and
sat
very
still
all
the
time
those
states
that
were
there
were
very
much
taken
with
him

The
King
of
Sweden
with
his
army
was
within
an
hour
going
from
Kunisberg
with
twenty
thousand
men
most
horse

The
elector
is
in
the
tone
and
has
also
which
they
say
is
twenty
thousand
also
he
has
torn
off
foot
then
the
King
has
also
torn
ambassador
go
this
week
from
hence
towards
Sueden
and
Denmark
one
of
those
that
goes
for
Denmark
is
Monsieur
d'Ameron
a
gentleman
of
Utrecht
a
very
honest
and
great
Royalist
and
so
you
may
be
sure
my
great
friend
but
I
believe
they
will
do
but
little
with
that
king
for
I
am
told
from
a
good
hand
that
he
and
the
K.
of
Sueden
are
in
very
good
intelligence
together
which
I
am
not
sorry
for
considering
how
little
these
states
assist
there
allies

My
dear
niece
continues
her
resolution
of
going
from
hence
Thursday
next
but
I
doubt
the
weather
will
hinder
for
it
thoughts
apace

I
am
ever
your
most
affectionate
friend

I
have
not
time
to
write
to
write
to
Mons
Soiret
but
tell
him
he
was
wished
her
upon
Friday
last

I
have
written
to
my
nephew
all
the
particulars
of
what
they
were
and
who
was
best
dressed

Mr
Secretary
I
hope
my
next
will
tell
you
of
my
sweet
nephews
being
welcome
to
Tailing
for
Mr.
Lovell
assures
us
all
here
that
he
is
perfectly
well

I
believe
M
Frasier
is
not
sorry
to
have
a
commission
to
wait
upon
him
this
way
for
so
he
may
see
his
Mistress
though
she
will
not
confess
him
so

I
know
not
how
your
people
at
Cologne
go
on
with
their
business
but
our
resident
Thom

was
asked
yesterday
for
the
first
time
and
so
was
Jack
Sayers

I
fear
resident
Hale
will
not
have
by
much
so
good
a
bargain
but
how
Bess
who
is
left
at
Brussels
will
take
it
for
she
has
written
a
terrible
letter
to
Sir
Charles
Cottrell
of
it
and
how
confident
she
is
of
her
masters
honesty
to
her
so
as
she
may
chance
forbid
the
bains

Vicfort
told
me
yesterday
that
Boudreaux
has
order
to
stay
yet
it
England
which
shows
what
you
believe
is
true

The
news
I
write
to
you
of
Poland
and
Sweden
is
most
true
and
that
De
Bre
makes
still
his
monitions
to
go
for
England

We
had
a
royalty
though
not
upon
twelfth
night
at
Tailing
where
my
niece
was
a
gipsy
and
became
her
dress
extreme
well
was
a
North Holland
born
Mrs.
Hide
a
shepherdess
and
I
assure
was
very
handsome
in
it
none
but
her
mistress
looked
better
than
she
did

Here
is
little
news
stirring

I
believe
you
heard
of
the
quarrel
between
my
soon
and
the
Elector
of
Ments
it
may
come
to
some
ill
business

It
is
so
cold
and
they
make
such
a
noise
with
their
bells
and
plaids
in
(
the
street
as
makes
me
end
but
am
ever
your
most
affectionate
friend

I
pray
remember
my
humble
service
to
the
king
and
in
my
name
make
a
humble
suit
to
him
in
Thom
Kill
grows
behalf

It
is
to
recommend
him
to
Prince
William
for
Captain
Morgan’s
company
who
is
dead

The
company
lies
at
Orzo
and
is
under
Eri

e
it
will
make
him
to
subsist
until
the
king
is
able
to
do
for
him
and
his
wife’s
friends
have
put
him
upon
it

I
would
not
trouble
his
Majesty
with
a
letter
since
you
are

the
place

not
yet
gone
from
Antwerp
but
I
hope
now
the
weather
is
better
and
I
shall
see
him
I
hope
shortly
for
as
soon
as
he
comes
to
Tailing
I
will
be
there

I
hope
it
is
a
good
prophesy
of
the
Electric
of
Brandenburg
having
a
son
but
she
does
look
to
be
delivered
before
the
end
of
this
month
or
the
beginning
of
the
next

The
letters
out
of
England
say
Cromwell
is
bringing
his
army
to
London
and
doubles
his
guards
plants
cannon
in
many
places
in
London
and
at
the
Toure
it
is
said
he
will
make
himself
king
by
force
since
he
cannot
be
so
otherwise

This
is
written
to
the
P

I
will
tell
Thom

Killegrew
what
the
king
answers

As
for
the
Archduke
he
may
thank
God
to
be
rid
of
the
Queen
of
Sueden
who
is
lodged
at
the
Count
of
Elmont’s
house
in
Brussels
where
she
stays
all
winter

My
Lord
Norwich
has
got
news
that
the
Archduke
goes
for
Spain
and
Don
John
of
Austria
comes
in
his
place
and
marries
the
Queen
of
Sueden
and
to
have
the
low
countries
as
the
Archduke
Albert
but
I
believe
it
not
there
is
nothing
else
that
I
have
to
say
to
you
but

think
it
will
easily
appear
that
the
consideration
of
my
kindness
is
well
deserved
by
them
provided
they
observe
the
condition
`there'
expressed
which
in
charity
I
am
bound
to
believe
they
will
and
without
which
their
own
consciences
and
the
world
will
know
how
to
judge
of
them

Having
said
this
I
or
rather
the
Lord
require
of
you
that
you
walk
in
all
peaceableness

gentleness
inoffensiveness
truth
and
love
towards

becomes
the

well
that
Jesus
Christ
of

both
they
and
you
are

it

Who
when
He
comes
to

His
people

to
make
Himself
"
a
name
and
"
praise
amongst
all
the

of
the

He
"

save
her

out

in

'To
his
Eminency
Cardinal
Mazarin.'
'Whitehall,'
26th
December
1656

The
obligations
and
many
instances
of
affection
which
I
have
received
from
your
eminency
do
engage
me
to
make
returns
suitable
to
your
merits

But
although
I
have
this
set
home
upon
my
spirit
I
may
not
(
shall
I
tell
you
I
cannot

at
this
juncture
of
time
and
as
the
face
of
my
affairs
now
stands
answer
to
your
call
for
toleration

I
say
I
cannot
as
to
a
public
declaration
of
my
sense
in
that
point
although
I
believe
that
under
my
government
your
eminency
in
the
behalf
of
Catholics
has
less
reason
for
complaint
as
to
rigour
upon
men's
consciences
than
under
the
parliament

For
I
have
of
some
and
those
very
many
had
compassion
making
a
difference

Truly
I
have
(
and
I
may
speak
it
with
cheerfulness
in
the
presence
of
god
who
is
a
witness
within
me
to
the
truth
of
what
I
affirm
made
a
difference
and
as
Jude
speaks
"
plucked
many
out
of
the
fire
the
raging
fire
of
persecution
which
did
tyrannise
over
their
consciences
and
encroached
by
an
arbitrariness
of
power
upon
their
estates

I
must
confess
that
I
had
some
doubts
of
its
success
till
providence
cleared
them
to
me
by
the
effects

I
was
truly
and
to
speak
ingenuously
not
without
doubtings
and
shall
not
be
ashamed
to
give
your
eminency
the
grounds
I
had
for
much
doubting

I
did
fear
that
Berkley
would
not
have
been
able
to
go
through
and
carry
on
that
work
and
that
either
the
Duke
would
have
cooled
in
his
suit
or
condescended
to
his
brother

I
doubted
also
that
those
instructions
which
I
sent
over
with
290
were
not
clear
enough
as
to
expressions
some
affairs
here
denying
me
leisure
at
that
time
to
be
so
particular
as
in
regard
to
some
circumstances
I
would

If
I
am
not
mistaken
in
the
Duke's
character
as
I
received
it
from
your
Eminency
that
fire
which
is
kindled
between
them
will
not
ask
bellows
to
blow
it
and
keep
it
burning

But
what
I
think
farther
necessary
in
this
matter
I
will
send
to
your
Eminency
by
Lockhart

And
now
I
shall
boast
to
your
Eminency
my
security
upon
a
wellbuilt
confidence
in
the
Lord
for
I
distrust
not
but
if
this
breach
be
widened
a
little
more
and
this
difference
fomented
with
a
little
caution
in
respect
of
the
persons
to
be
added
to
it
I
distrust
not
but
that
party
which
is
already
forsaken
of
God
as
to
an
outward
dispensation
of
mercies
and
noisome
to
their
countrymen
will
grow
lower
in
the
opinion
of
all
the
world

If
I
have
troubled
your
Eminency
too
long
in
this
you
may
impute
it
to
the
resentment
of
joy
which
I
have
for
the
issue
of
this
affair
and
`I'
will
conclude
with
giving
you
assurance
that
I
will
never
be
backward
in
demonstrating
as
becomes
your
brother
and
confederate
that
I
am
Your
servant
Oliver
P

And
that
which
increases
our
sense
`of
this'
is
the
resolution
we
`for
our
part'
had
rather
to
overdo
than
to
be
behindhand
in
anything
of
our
treaty

And
although
we
never
were
so
foolish
`as'
to
apprehend
that
the
French
and
their
interests
were
the
same
with
ours
in
all
things
yet
as
to
the
Spaniard
who
has
been
known
in
all
ages
to
be
the
most
implacable
enemy
that
France
has
we
never
could
doubt
before
we
made
our
treaty
that
going
upon
such
grounds
we
should
have
been
failed
`towards'
as
we
are

To
talk
of
`giving
us
garrisons'
which
are
inland
as
caution
for
future
action
to
talk
of
`what
will
be
done
next
campaign,'
are
but
parcels
of
words
for
children

If
they
will
give
us
garrisons
let
them
give
us
Calais
Dieppe
and
Bologna
which
I
think
they
will
do
as
soon
as
be
honest
in
their
words
in
giving
us
any
one
Spanish
garrison
upon
the
coast
into
our
hands

I
positively
think
which
I
say
to
you
they
are
afraid
we
should
have
any
footing
on
that
side
`of
the
water,'
though
Spanish

I
pray
you
tell
the
cardinal
from
me
that
I
think
if
France
desires
to
maintain
its
ground
much
more
to
get
ground
upon
the
Spaniard
the
performance
of
his
treaty
with
us
will
better
do
it
than
anything
appears
we
cannot
so
well
pretend
to
soldiery
as
those
that
are
with
him
yet
we
think
that
we
being
able
by
sea
to
strengthen
and
secure
his
siege
and
`to'
reinforce
it
as
we
please
by
sea
and
the
enemy
`being'
in
capacity
to
do
nothing
to
relieve
it
the
best
time
to
besiege
that
place
will
be
now

Especially
if
we
consider
that
the
French
horse
will
be
able
so
to
ruin
Flanders
as
that
no
succour
can
be
brought
to
relieve
the
place
and
that
the
French
army
and
our
own
will
have
constant
relief
as
far
as
England
and
France
especially
considering
the
Dutch
are
now
engaged
so
much
to
southward
as
they
are

I
desire
you
to
let
him
know
that
Englishmen
have
had
so
good
experience
of
winter
expeditions
they
are
confident
if
the
Spaniard
shall
keep
the
field
as
he
cannot
impede
this
work
so
neither
will
he
be
able
to
attack
anything
towards
France
with
a
possibility
of
retreat

I
desire
we
may
know
what
France
says
and
will
do
upon
this
point

We
shall
be
ready
still
as
the
Lord
shall
assist
us
to
perform
what
can
be
reasonably
expected
on
our
part

And
you
may
also
let
the
cardinal
know
father
that
our
intentions
as
they
have
been
will
be
to
do
all
the
good
offices
we
can
to
promote
the
interest
common
to
us

Apprehending
it
is
of
moment
that
this
business
should
come
to
you
with
speed
and
surety
we
have
sent
it
by
an
express

Gentlemen
my
worthy
friends
Although
during
the
necessary
absence
of
my
partner
Mr.
Ramsden
I
write
but
with
half
a
penny
and
can
scarce
persuade
myself
to
send
you
so
imperfect
an
account
of
your
own
and
the
public
affairs
as
I
needs
must
for
want
of
his
assistance
yet
I
had
rather
expose
mine
own
defects
to
your
good
interpretation
than
excuse
thereby
a
total
neglect
of
my
duty
and
that
trust
which
is
divided
upon
me

At
my
late
absence
out
of
town
I
had
taken
such
order
that
if
you
had
commanded
me
any
thing
I
might
soon
have
received
it
and
so
returned
on
purpose
to
this
place
to
have
obeyed
you

There
is
yet
brought
in
an
act
in
which
of
all
others
your
corporation
is
the
least
concerned
that
is
where
wives
shall
refuse
to
cohabit
with
their
husbands
that
in
such
case
the
husband
shall
not
be
liable
to
pay
any
debts
which
she
shall
run
into
for
clothing
diet
lodging
or
other
expenses

I
wish
with
all
my
heart
you
were
no
more
touched
in
a
vote
that
we
have
made
for
bringing
in
an
act
of
a
new
assessment
for
six
months
of
70000
pounds
per
mensem
to
begin
next
January

The
truth
is
the
delay
ere
moneys
can
be
got
in
eats
up
a
great
part
of
all
that
is
levying
and
that
growing
charge
of
the
army
and
navy
doubles
upon
us

And
that
is
all
that
can
be
said
for
excuse
of
ourselves
to
the
country
to
whom
we
had
given
our
own
hopes
of
no
further
assessment
to
be
raised
but
must
now
needs
incur
the
censure
of
improvidence
before
or
prodigality
now
though
it
becomes
no
private
member
the
resolution
having
passed
the
house
to
interpose
further
his
own
judgement
in
a
thing
that
can
not
be
remedied
and
it
will
be
each
man’s
ingenuity
not
to
grudge
an
afterpayment
for
that
settlement
and
freedom
from
armies
and
navies
which
before
he
would
have
been
glad
to
purchase
with
his
whole
fortune

There
remain
some
eight
regiments
to
be
disbanded
but
those
all
horse
in
a
manner
and
some
seventeen
ships
to
be
paid
of
that
have
laid
so
long
upon
charge
in
the
harbour
beside
fourscore
ships
which
are
reckoned
to
us
for
this
winter
guard
but
after
that
all
things
are
to
go
upon
his
Majesty’s
own
purse
out
of
the
tonnage
and
poundage
and
his
other
revenues

But
there
being
so
great
a
provision
made
for
money
I
doubt
not
but
ere
we
rise
to
see
the
whole
army
disbanded
and
according
to
the
act
hope
to
see
your
town
once
more
ungarrisoned
in
which
I
should
be
glad
and
happy
to
be
instrumental
to
the
uttermost
for
I
can
not
but
remember
though
then
a
child
those
blessed
days
when
the
youth
of
your
own
town
were
trained
for
your
militia
and
did
methought
become
their
arms
much
better
than
any
soldiers
that
I
have
seen
there
since

And
it
will
not
be
amiss
if
you
please
(
now
that
we
are
about
a
new
act
of
regulating
the
Militia
that
it
may
be
as
a
standing
strength
but
not
as
ill
as
a
perpetual
army
to
the
Nation
to
signify
to
me
any
thing
in
that
matter
that
were
according
to
your
ancient
custom
and
desirable
for
you

For
though
I
can
promise
little
yet
I
intend
all
things
for
your
service

The
purchasers
the
other
day
offered
the
house
600000
pounds
in
ready
money
and
to
make
the
bishops
etc.
revenue
as
good
or
better
than
before

But
the
House
thought
it
not
fit
or
seasonable
to
hearken
to
it

We
are
so
much
the
more
concerned
to
see
that
great
interest
of
the
purchasers
satisfied
and
quieted
at
least
in
that
way
which
our
own
votes
have
propounded

On
Monday
next
we
are
to
return
to
the
consideration
of
apportioning
100000
pounds
per
annum
upon
all
the
lands
in
the
nation
in
lieu
of
the
court
of
wards

The
debate
among
the
counties
each
thinking
it
self
overrated
makes
the
success
of
that
business
something
casual
and
truly
I
shall
not
assist
it
much
for
my
part
for
it
is
little
reason
that
your
town
should
contribute
in
that
charge

The
excise
bill
for
longer
continuance
(
I
wish
it
prove
not
too
long
will
come
in
also
next
week
and
I
foresee
we
shall
be
called
upon
shortly
to
effect
our
vote
made
the
former
sitting
of
raising
his
Majesty’s
revenue
to
1200000
pounds
per
annum
I
do
not
love
to
write
so
much
of
this
money
news
but
I
think
you
have
observed
that
parliaments
have
been
always
made
use
of
to
that
purpose
and
though
we
may
buy
gold
too
dear
yet
we
must
at
any
rate
be
glad
of
peace
freedom
and
a
good
conscience

Mr.
Mayor
tells
me
your
duplicates
of
the
poll
are
coming
up
I
shall
go
with
them
to
the
exchequer
and
make
your
excuse
if
any
be
requisite

My
long
silence
has
made
me
now
trespass
on
the
other
hand
in
a
long
letter
but
I
doubt
not
of
your
good
construction
of
so
much
familiarity
and
trouble
from
Gentlemen
Your
most
affectionate
friend
and
servant
Andrew
Marvell

I
received
today
another
letter
of
yours
of
the
17th
directed
to
my
self
and
Mr.
Ramsden
who
is
not
yet
arrived
in
Mr.
Wilsons
business

He
has
been
with
me
and
seems
to
build
much
upon
my
advise

I
counselled
him
before
I
had
yours
in
any
case
not
to
think
any
more
of
Hezle
but
if
he
could
(
as
he
said
he
had
some
hopes
to
make
for
Leeds
upon
Mr.
Stiles
his
acceptance
of
Hezle

I
shall
be
very
tender
and
sensible
of
your
interest
herein
and
shall
afford
him
no
assistance
but
on
the
contrary
in
anything
reflecting
upon
your
proceedings

But
as
far
as
I
can
understand
him
and
I
shall
now
be
the
more
watchful
over
him
he
has
wholly
laid
by
any
such
thoughts
and
his
whole
design
is
now
upon
Leeds

Yesterday
after
a
long
debate
upon
the
compensation
for
the
Court
of
Wards
it was
resolved
that
for
the
tenures
of
lands
in
capite
knights
service
Court
of
Wards
and
all
the
emoluments
thereof
and
for
taking
away
of
purveyance
the
king
should
have
in
perpetuity
one
moiety
of
the
excise
of
beer
and
ale

The
other
moiety
was
not
then
disposed
of
but
'it is
likely
will
come
in
into
the
yearly
revenue
of
1200000
pounds
which
must
be
settled

Today
we
were
upon
the
act
of
militia
which
is
referred
to
a
committee
of
the
whole
house
on
Saturday
next

I
remain
gentlemen
Your
most
affectionate
friend
and
servant
Andrew
Marvell

Westminster
November
22

1660

Gentlemen
since
my
last
to
you
the
House
has
been
for
the
most
part
busied
in
carrying
on
and
maturing
those
bills
which
I
formerly
signified
to
you
to
be
under
consideration

Today
upon
the
recommitment
I
made
my
second
report
of
that
very
good
bill
for
erecting
and
augmenting
vicarages
out
of
all
impropriations
belonging
to
archbishops
deans
and
chapters
or
any
other
ecclesiastical
person
or
corporation
to
80
pounds
per
annum
where
the
impropriation
amounts
to
120
pounds
and
where
less
to
one
moiety
of
the
profits
of
such
impropriation
and
the
bill
upon
reading
the
amendments
was
ordered
to
be
engrossed

After
that
the
House
fell
upon
the
making
out
of
the
King’s
revenue
to
1200000
pounds
a
year
and
have
voted
that
the
other
moiety
of
the
excise
of
beer
and
ale
shall
be
given
to
his
Majesty
for
life
to
make
up
the
full
of
the
said
1200000
pounds
a
year

And
that
the
members
of
the
Privy
Counsel
acquaint
his
Majesty
from
the
House
with
their
unanimity
herein
in
gratitude
for
his
Majesty's
gracious
declarations
and
acts
of
grace
to
the
kingdom
the
customs
are
estimated
toward
500000
pounds
per
annum
in
this
revenue
his
lands
and
fee
farms
250000
pounds
the
excise
of
beer
and
ale
300000
pounds
the
rest
arises
out
of
the
post
office
wine
licences
stanneries
courts
probates
of
wills
postfines
forests
and
other
rights
of
the
crown

The
excise
of
foreign
commodities
is
to
be
continued
apart
until
satisfaction
of
public
debts
and
engagements
secured
upon
the
excise

This
is
all
of
present
news

remain
gentlemen
Your
most
affectionate
friend

Andrew
Marvell

Westminster
November
27

1660

I
beseech
you
let
me
hear
whether
my
partner
Mr.
Ramsden
be
likely
to
come
up
or
no
for
he
is
not
yet
arrived

Mr.
Wilson
pursues
his
design
for
Leeds

Mr.
Winchester
has
been
very
careful
in
the
businesses
you
employed
him
in
here

To
Mayor
Richardson

We
have
been
with
my
Lord
Bellasis
and
presented
him
his
and
your
letter

He
gives
you
very
many
thanks
and
as
to
the
business
of
cutting
of
Hull
from
Hezle
he
answered
what
indeed
we
expected
that
he
should
willingly
contribute
his
best
towards
it
at
any
time
but
it
being
to
be
done
by
act
of
parliament
it
was
at
present
our
dissolution
being
so
sudden
absolutely
impossible

Had
you
pleased
to
give
order
sooner
to
us
it
might
have
been
effected
and
an
act
prepared
for
it
might
have
passed
but
as
we
said
there
are
so
many
public
bills
depending
and
our
time
so
short
that
should
you
give
a
1000
pounds
it
could
never
be
got
into
the
house
to
be
once
read
this
Parliament

All
these
bills
are
yet
before
us
in
our
house

For
taking
away
Court
of
Wards
and
settling
one
moiety
of
excise
in
perpetuum

For
settling
the
other
moiety
for
life

For
the
militia

For
6
months
assessment

For
review
of
poll
money

For
settling
post
office
in
his
Majesty

For
gathering
arrears
of
excise
and
settling
the
foreign
excise
for
some
time
and
paying
public
debts
secured
upon
it

For
tobacco
not
to
be
planted
in
England

For
wine
licences

For
draining
the
fens

For
tanning
leather

For
increasing
fishery

For
confirming
college
leases

For
uniting
Dunkirk
and
Jamaica
to
the
Crown

For
paying
some
moneys
in
arrears
for
Piedmont

For
indemnifying
officers
in
courts
of
justice

For
confirm
marriages

For
enabling
Durham
to
send
members
to
parliament

For
confirming
Magna
Charta
and
a
proclamation
against
priests
and
Jesuits

And
beside
what
we
have
sent
for
their
concurrence
and
not
returned
since
this
sitting

Against
swearing

Against
transporting
wool
etc.
For
vicarages

And
after
all
these
public
as
many
private
bills
more
and
but
ten
sitting
days
left

You
must
please
to
reserve
his
for
next
parliament

it
timely
in

We

your

to

with
words
of
civility

We
have
agreed
to
treat
with
him
upon
Monday

We
shall
be

we

with
him

For
your
security
is
perfectly
good

We
believe
it was
given
you
by
the
parliament
in
compensation
of
great
losses
you
sustained
in
the
war

It

We

Mr.

Mr.

procured
a

To

December

1660

Gentlemen
Since
our
last
we
have
delivered
yours
to
my
Lord
Bellasis
who
is
always
very
kind
and
ready
to
further
you
in
anything

He
says
Mr.
Hebird
has
been
with
him
and
that
he
gave
him
advice
till
Mr.
Stiles
should
be
able
to
come
to
Hull
that
he
should
continue
there
and
promised
him
that
he
will
contribute
what
he
can
towards
his
abiding
with
you

So
that
if
he
fail
in
his
business
it
must
have
been
by
his
own
ill
management

We
conceive
it
might
be
fitting
for
you
now
to
be
sending
some
answer
in
Mr.
Hilyard‘s
business
which
he
is
very
solicitous
about

If
it
be
negative
your
own
judgements
will
easily
perfect
it
better
out
of
that
matter
couched
in
our
former
letter

If
otherwise
it
is
much
easier

The
house
has
sent
up
to
the
Lords
the
bill
for
review
of
the
poll
and
the
two
bills
for
the
two
moieties
of
the
excise

But
that
for
foreign
and
inland
commodities
is
not
yet
out
of
doubt
with
us

That
for
6
months
assess
is
well-nigh
finished

And
we
have
given
his
Majesty
yet
one
month
assess
more
to
buy
jewels
for
his
crown
and
a
jewell
of
1000
pounds
to
Colonel
Windam
who
was
very
instrumental
in
his
Majesty's
escape

Major
White
was
a
principal
in
it
and
reveals
others

Colonel
Overton
and
divers
others
are
apprehended
hereupon
and
put
in
the
Tower

We
have
not
further
but
to
remain
Gentlemen
Your
most
affectionate
friends
and

To

Westminster
December

1660

Gentlemen
Our
business
in
parliament
not
being
yet
completed
his
Majesty
has
deferred
to
dissolve
us
till
Saturday
next
and
we
expect
that
day
may
hold

For
this
day
and
tomorrow
we
have
adjourned

The
other
bill
giving
the
other
moiety
to
his
Majesty
for
life
towards
the
making
up
of
his
whole
yearly
revenue
1200000
pounds

The
bills
for
wine
licences

For
the
post
for
review
of
the
poll
for
6
months
assessment
for
one
month
sessment
towards
expense
of
coronation
for
arrears
of
twelve
and
three
months
assessment
for
arrears
of
excise
are
all
ready
but
not
yet
passed

The
excise
of
foreign
and
inland
commodities
it is
hoped
may
now
fall
to
the
ground

Yet
before
we
rise
it
will
undergo
a
very
stiff
debate
on
both
sides
by
reason
of
some
public
debts
formerly
secured
and
others
desired
to
be
added
there
upon

The
jealousy
is
least
this
excise
should
also
be
perpetuated
for
there
will
never
want
public
debts
to
be
engrafted
upon
it

There
has
been
a
motion
and
likely
to
be
renewed
in
the
House
for
an
act
to
empower
commissioners
to
receive
the
voluntary
benevolence
of
all
persons
through
the
country
towards
his
Majesty's
coronation

But
we
hope
it
will
not
take

The
Princess
of
Orange
died
yesterday
at
his
Majesty’s
return
from
the
Lords’
House
having
been
some
five
days
sick
of
the
small
pox
or
measles
or
spotted
fever
the
physicians
disagreeing
whether

She
was
thrice
let
blood

The
Lord
sanctify
his
hand
to
us
all

We
remain
yours
John
Ramsden
Andrew
Marvell
Mr.
Hebird
has
not
in
all
this
while
seen
either
of
us
so
that
we
are
at
a
loss
in
his
business
and
can
only
contribute
our
good
wishes
towards
it

To
Mayor
Richardson

Worthy
Sir
The
business
of
the
House
has
not
been
of
very
public
consequence
yesterday
being
taken
up
by
a
petition
preferred
by
one
Mr.
Liddall
that
the
House
would
give
him
leave
to
prosecute
at
law
Sir
John
Morly
a
member
of
the
House
for
Newcastle
upon
a
charge
of
high
treason
for
some
correspondence
he
had
held
with
Oliver
Cromwell
and
money
which
he
had
in
earnest
thereof
received
of
Sir
George
Downing
when
resident
in
Holland

For
the
kings
menial
servants
or
those
which
acted
by
instructions
from
the
king
betraying
their
trust
are
excepted
out
of
the
act
of
indemnity

The
House
left
Liddall
to
prosecute
him
at
law

The
committee
for
confirming
the
acts
of
the
last
parliament
sat
yesterday
also
and
are
carrying
100
pounds
on
that
business
but
indeed
the
bill
then
passed
for
confirmation
of
ministers
will
I
doubt
undergo
a
very
hard
scrutiny
so
that
I
think
as
I
intimated
to
you
in
my
last
whosoever
have
the
business
of
their
ministers
in
a
present
tolerable
and
secure
posture
had
best
make
much
of
that
and
not
expose
themselves
to
a
further
hazard

I
believe
in
this
conjuncture
I
shall
be
left
single
in
attempting
any
thing
for
your
patronage
notwithstanding
the
assistance
you
expected
from
some
others

For
so
they
signify
to
me

And
I
doubt
you
will
hardly
agree
about
the
levying
of
your
ministers
maintenance

But
in
this
thing
according
as
I
write
to
you
you
must
please
to
be
very
reserved
and
rest
very
much
upon
your
own
prudence

I
would
not
have
you
suspect
any
misintelligence
betwixt
my
partner
and
me
because
we
write
not
to
you
joyntly
as
Mr.
Ramsden
and
I
used

For
there
is
all
civility
betwixt
us

But
it
was
his
sense
that
we
should
each
be
left
to
his
own
discretion
for
writing
except
upon
some
answer
unto
your
letters
and
that
to
be
jointly

Gentlemen
our
very
worthy
friends
We
would
not
let
the
first
letter
which
we
have
had
the
honour
to
receive
from
you
(
of
the
14
May
lie
by
us
without
return
till
the
next
post
choosing
rather
to
be
something
imperfect
than
wholly
defective
in
answering
you
about
your
business
and
rendering
our
own
due
respects
and
civilities
to
you

We
are
willingly
quickened
by
you
for
the
act
of
separation
of
your
church
from
Hessel
and
thank
you
for
what
you
contribute
towards
it
in
the
papers
you
enclosed

Whereby
there
seems
to
us
little
to
be
wanting
towards
the
expedition
of
that
bill
which
is
in
good
forwardness
to
be
presented
to
the
House
but
that
you
be
pleased
to
deal
with
all
those
in
your
town
who
shall
by
this
act
be
made
contributory
to
such
maintenance
for
your
minister
for
their
general
and
particular
consent
towards
it
by
their
subscribing
to
a
paper
testifying
their
assent

For
the
parliament
is
always
very
nice
and
curious
in
this
point
of
involving
men
in
any
assess
or
contribution
of
this
nature
without
their
voluntary
and
express
concurrence

That
patent
of
ballast
is
grievous
alike
to
all
the
ports
and
if
we
can
pitch
upon
some
common
way
to
seek
redress
with
that
modesty
which
is
expedient
where
his
Majesty's
seal
is
in
the
case
we
shall
incite
and
join
with
those
that
have
the
same
interest

As
to
your
patent
for
the
gauging
of
wines
and
your
former
power
to
grant
four
wine
licences
it
shall
be
our
care
betwixt
this
and
our
next
letter
to
give
you
a
good
account
and
do
you
the
best
service
therein
as
in
all
other
matters
recommended
by
you
or
occurring
to
us

The
newest
matters
here
are
the
engrossing
of
the
act
for
safety
of
the
King’s
person

The
bill
for
the
militia
read
once

A
bill
for
enabling
church-wardens
to
rate
such
moneys
as
are
necessary
for
the
repair
of
the
churches
etc.
and
an
order
sent
to
the
Lords
for
their
concurrence
for
burning
the
covenant
by
the
common
hangman
and
taking
it
down
in
all
churches
which
though
not
unanimous
yet
was
carried
by
228
voices
against
103

We
are
as
much
straitened
in
paper
and
time
at
present
as
we
shall
be
always
enlarged
in
affection
and
service
to
you
being
Your
most
affectionate
friends
to
serve
you
Antho
Gylby
Andrew
Marvell

We
see
among
the
rest
of
your
papers
that
declaration
of
Mr.
Raiks
his
(
before
he
had
got
Hessell
toward
the
separation

It's
as
necessary
that
(
now
he
is
possessed
of
Hessell
he
do
some
new
writing
witness
his
consent
thereto
Antho
Gylby

Gentlemen
In
addition
to
what
we
wrote
you
last
you
may
please
to
take
notice
that
whereas
in
your
letter
to
us
you
say
a
sum
not
exceeding
250
pounds
per
annum
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
you
ascertain
in
express
words
the
sum
that
is
to
be
raised
by
pound
rent
without
leaving
it
so
far
indefinite

But
if
you
had
once
got
the
consent
and
subscription
of
all
those
particular
persons
who
are
to
contribute
after
the
separation
to
the
maintenance
of
your
ministers
(
which
can
not
neither
properly
be
had
but
to
a
certain
sum
you
should
then
find
for
the
rest
that
your
bill
should
have
as
quick
a
dispatch
as
you
or
we
can
desire

In
that
matter
of
ballast
we
have
spoken
with
the
members
of
several
ports
who
are
sensible
of
that
grievance
and
we
are
deliberating
how
to
proceed
therein
either
by
petition
to
his
Majesty
for
reversing
the
patent
or
else
by
a
short
act
for
that
end

As
for
the
patent
for
gauging
of
wines
we
think
the
sooner
you
send
up
your
charter
for
that
from
king
James
that
it
may
be
renewed
the
better
you
will
do
and
then
will
be
the
most
natural
time
to
take
notice
of
that
of
Palmers

For
your
four
wine
licences
by
statute
of
Edward
the
6th
we
have
appointed
a
meeting
with
Mr.
Recorder
before
the
next
post
and
according
as
we
shall
upon
the
discussing
of
it
find
you
more
or
less
concerned
we
shall
in
the
bill
for
confirmation
of
public
acts
wherein
also
is
that
for
wine
licences
interpose
for
the
preservation
of
your
interest
therein

We
remain
in
some
haste
Gentlemen
Your
most
affectionate
friends
to
serve
you
Antho
Gylby

Westminster
May

1661

Pray
by
the
next
post
send
me
word
when
I
may
expect
you
and
how
far
you
would
have
my
coach
to
meet
you

I
hear
a
flying
report
of
your
being
to
be
married
but
to
whom
none
could
tell
me

I
hope
it
is
not
true
it
being
that
which
I
would
admire
you
to
defer
as
long
as
your
friends
will
suffer
you

When
I
left
you
we
were
both
of
the
same
opinion
and
I
hope
as
yet
you
have
not
changed
it

If
you
have
I
am
one
of
the
inluckiest
creatures
alive
in
flattering
myself
with
the
belief
of
enjoying
your
company
which
if
this
be
true
I
shall
not

Pray
deal
clearly
with
me
and
send
me
word
if
I
am
to
credit
a
report
that
assumes
a
very
sensible
trouble
to
YOURS

Direct
your
letters
to
Derby
to
be
sent
to
Bredbye

For
the
Lady
Giffard
at
Mr.
Wing's
house
over
against
new
street
and
in
St.
Martin's
Lane
London

That
person
is
so
inconsiderable
to
me
when
any
insinuations
of
this
come
in
balance
with
the
affection
I
have
for
you
as
nothing
in
the
world
would
be
of
less
weight
but
I
assure
you
upon
my
word
that
I
am
certain
they
never
have
as
they
have
not
to
me
said
any
such
thing
to
any
body
and
if
this
is
not
a
cruel
denial
that
you
have
made
to
put
me
of
it
is
the
greatest
piece
of
malice
in
your
informer
to
G

O

that
ever
I
heard
of
for
to
my
knowledge
they
do
not
speak
better
of
any
person
than
they
have
done
before
me
of
your
friend
and
G

O

has
a
very
particular
respect
for
her
but
had
they
the
greatest
aversion
to
her
imaginable
nothing
of
this
should
deter
me
from
pressing
the
same
request
with
as
much
heat
as
ever
besides
I
am
so
free
as
to
the
power
of
giving
that
person
all
the
welcome
that
they
can
expect
as
due
to
their
merit
that
I
am
very
indifferent
whether
G

O

be
satisfied
with
my
choice
or
no
since
I
am
sure
the
only
body
that
I
am
obliged
by
duty
or
inclination
to
consider
is
very
extremely
well
pleased
with
the
Caviller
I
have
made
him
of
I
think
the
worthiest
woman
in
the
world
and
to
her
I
bend
all
my
desire
and
my
hopes
are
fixed
upon
her
constancy
to
welcome
without
reluctance
the
promise
you
made
so
much
in
favour
of-YOURS

Farewell
my
dear
Friend

MY
DEAR
FRIEND
-
I
am
extremely
troubled
to
find
by
yours
of
the
20th
that
I
am
not
to
expect
the
satisfaction
of
your
company
for
a
long
continuance
till
after
your
sister
is
up
again
and
though
I
own
I
am
very
covetous
of
it
sooner
yet
I
will
not
be
so
foolishly
fond
of
it
as
to
press
you
to
for
so
very
short
a
time
pray
send
me
word
if
you
think
it
impossible
for
your
sister
to
be
persuaded
to
dispense
with
your
absence
while
she
lays
for
if
she
would
be
so
self
denying
and
so
very
obliging
to
me
that
longs
of
all
things
in
the
world
to
see
you
I
should
acknowledge
it
the
greatest
generosity
for
her
imaginable
and
a
very
peculiar
honour
to
me
as
for
what
you
apprehend
of
Mrs
Scrope's
power
with
me
to
your
prejudice
your
justification
on
that
point
is
very
unnecessary
for
I
assure
you
the
esteem
&
kindness
I
have
for
you
is
much
above
the
civility
I
have
for
her
besides
I
have
so
general
a
justice
for
all
persons
as
never
to
condemn
any
with
out
indeniabIe
proofs
of
their
guilt
but
Mrs
Scrow
(
Scrope
is
so
little
a
person
in
my
opinion
and
so
seldom
in
my
thoughts
that
whoever
gave
her
that
information
I
forgive
them
though
I
do
not
remember
I
told
anybody
of
the
kind
things
she
said
of
me
but
I
will
never
believe
it
was
you
when
you
have
thoughts
of
coming
to
Bredby
send
me
word
and
my
coach
shall
meet
you
at
Northampton
to
which
place
coaches
come
twice
a
week
so
that
with
all
the
convenience
you
can
wish
for
you
can
come
hether
send
me
word
by
the
next
post
how
you
like
this
proposition
if
you
do
not
there
are
outlier
towns
you
may
your
coach
to
come
to
if
you
have
any
kindness
for
me
hasten
me
the
happiness
I
beg
of
for
nobody
living
loves
you
so
well
as-YOURS

MY
DEAR
FRIEND
I
expected
to
have
heard
from
you
many
posts
since
in
answer
to
a
letter
of
mine
wherein
I
desired
to
know
when
I
should
send
my
coach
to
Northampton
for
you

I
hear
it
miscarried
and
so
am
writing
again
to
trouble
you
with
the
same
question

I
hope
by
this
time
your
sister
is
brought
to
bed
and
very
well
and
that
you
will
no
longer
delay
me
of
a
happiness
I
cannot
be
satisfied
without

I
am
now
all
alone
and
am
likely
to
be
so
to
my
Lord's
business
keeping
him
in
town

I
knew
nothing
of
returning
in
to
Ireland
and
I
do
believe
I
never
shall
being
very
well
settled
here
and
perfectly
contented
I
shall
be
when
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
perform
the
promise
you
have
made
to
my
dear
friend

YOURS

WILLINGBOR0W
20th
of
June
1665

Direct
your
letters
to
Northampton
to
be
sent
on
to
me
at
Willingborrow
and
I
shall
certainly
receive
them
for
your
greater
imitation
my
Lady
Ruthin
is
within
4
miles
of
this
town

MY
DEAREST
HEART
Forby
did
me
great
wrong
in
not
delivering
the
long
script
I
sent
you
I
know
if
you
had
seen
it
before
you
wrote
yours
would
have
been
something
longer
than
it
is

But
I
am
thankful
however
and
indeed
you
sent
me
very
good
news
of
my
aunt's
stay
in
town
for
the
thought
of
that
journey
was
not
very
pleasant
to
me

I
am
glad
you
have
found
a
footman
too
and
Tom
shall
be
sent
up
as
you
appoint
but
how
will
you
do
to
return
your
money

I
am
in
some
pain
for
you

Mr.
Lawfort
has
made
up
a
bill
of
L15
odd
money
L5
we
had
before
and
L5
now
and
the
linnen
with
some
odd
things
you
had
buttons
and
silk
&c.
I
sent
to
our

Mr.
Osgood
to
know
if
he
could
help
us
but
he
is
not
provided
at
present
he
says

I
do
not
think
but
Mr.
Ward
of
Newgate
Market
could
do
it
he
has
acquaintance
here
for
I
have
had
letters
sent
me
from
him
by
townsmen
if
you
have
any
from
Ireland
pray
let
me
have
them
to
entertain
myself
with
all
till
you
come

Jack

Coly

my
Lady
says
she
believes
she
is
never
to
see
you
there
I
said
what
I
could
to
excuse
you
but
you
are
concluded
the
arrantest
gadder
in
the
country
none
matter
though
my
dear
I
love
you
for
all
that
so
will
haste
home
again

Do
you
mean
to
look
for
some
lodgings
and
room
to
lay
our
goods
in

must
be

MY
DEAREST
HEART
After
all
Mr.
Mayor's
preparations
it was
a
very
poor
fair
not
a
good
horse
in it
besides
Sawyer's
team
in
which
was
the
mare
he
told
you
of
and
he
brought
her
down
to
the
stable
to
match
her
with
my
aunts
and
she
do
very
well
together
he
says
but
I
did
not
see
it
for
though
I
sent
twenty
messengers
to
him
Sadler
would
not
come
near
me
all
the
faire
day
but
sent
me
word
at
night
what
he
had
done
which
was
that
on
Saturday
next
here
would
come
two
mares
for
you
to
see

Today
I
sent
for
him
again
and
he
tells
me
the
mares
are
both
Sawyer's
both
4
years
old
and
full
as
large
as
my
aunts'
and
the
same
colour
and
will
both
come
to
about
L30
one
of
them
he
has
been
offered
L16
for
and
he
takes
her
to
be
better
than
my
aunts'
and
if
you
like
them
you
may
have
them
if
not
there is
no
harm
done
he
is
not
fond
of
selling
them
I
have
seen
the
young
fellow
he
looks
plain
and
honest
will
undertake
he
says
to
look
to
your
4
horses
very
well
and
with
as
much
care
as
any
man

Sadler
recommends
him
mightily
he
drove
his
brother's
coach
the
Gloucester
Road
a
great
while
he
asks
L12
a
year
and
cannot
take
under
he
says

Can
you
tell
me
when
you
intend
to
come
home
would
you
would
I
should
take
it
mighty
kindly
good
dear
make
haste
I
am
as
weary
as
a
dog
without
his
master
your
poor
Jack
is
all
the
entertainment
I
have
he
minds
his
little
duty
and
grows
and
thrives
every
day

When
the
sun
shines
his
maid
has
him
abroad
to
use
him
to
go
to
Coly
upon
a
solemn
invitation

My
dear
Heart
be
sure
I
have
a
script
by
Tuesday's
coach
and
no
reproaches
remember
that
indeed
I
don't
deserve
them
I
think
for
I
am
sure
I
infinitely
love
my
dearest
dear
heart
and
am
his

D.
TEMPLE

MY
DEAREST
HEART
I
send
you
here
a
letter
that
will
amaze
you
I
believe
as
much
as
it
did
me
but
it is
most
happy
that
he
is
thus
discovered
before
he
has
done
a
worse
mischief

Rid
your
hands
of
him
quickly
for
God's
sake
since
I
knew
this
I
have
broken
open
his
box
but
found
nothing
there
but
his
own
things
his
new
suit
and
most
of
his
linnen
unless
it
be
the
cape
of
your
plush
cloak
which
I
have
sent
lest
you
might
want
it

Poor
Mr.
Rolles
brought
this
letter
through
all
the
rain
today

My
dear
dear
heart
make
haste
home
I
do
so
want
you
that
I
cannot
imagine
how
I
did
so
endure
your
being
so
long
away
when
your
business
was
in
hand

DEAR
MADAM
You
treat
me
in
your
letters
so
much
to
my
advantage
and
above
my
merit
that
I
am
almost
affrayed
to
tell
you
how
exceedingly
I
am
pleased
with
them
lest
you
should
attribute
that
contentment
to
the
delight
I
take
in
being
praised
whereas
I
am
extremely
deceived
if
that
be
the
ground
of
it
though
I
confess
it
is
not
free
from
vanity

I
cannot
choose
but
be
proud
of
being
owned
by
so
valuable
a
person
as
you
are
and
one
whom
all
my
inclinations
carry
me
to
honour
and
love
at
a
very
great
rate
and
you
will
find
by
the
trouble
I
last
gave
you
of
this
kind
how
impossible
it
will
be
for
you
to
be
rid
of
an
importunity
which
you
have
much
encouraged
and
how
much
your
late
silence
alarmed
one
that
is
so
much
concerned
for
the
honour
you
do
her
in
allowing
her
to
hope
you
will
frequently
let
her
know
she
has
some
room
in
your
particular
favour
I
hope
you
have
pardoned
me
that
complaint
and
allowed
a
little
jealousy
to
the
great
passion
I
have
for
you
and
that
I
shall
with
some
more
assurance
come
to
thank
you
for
this
last
favour
of
12th
instant
and
must
beg
you
to
believe
that
if
my
convent
were
in
Cataya
and
I
a
recluse
by
vow
to
it
yet
I
should
never
attain
mortification
enough
to
be
able
willingly
to
deny
myself
the
great
entertainment
of
your
correspondance
which
seems
to
remove
me
out
of
a
solitary
religious
house
on
the
mountains
and
place
me
in
the
most
advantageous
prospect
upon
both
court
and
town
and
give
me
right
to
a
better
place
than
of
either
and
that
madam
is
your
friendship
which
is
so
great
a
present
that
there
is
but
one
way
to
make
it
more
valuable
and
that
is
by
making
it
less
ceremonious
and
by
using
me
with
a
freedom
that
may
give
me
more
access
into
your
heart
and
this
beg
from
you
with
a
great
earnestness
and
will
promise
you
that
whatsoever
liberties
of
that
kind
you
allow
me
that
I
will
never
so
much
abase
that
goodness
as
to
press
mine
own
advantages
further
than
you
shall
permit
or
lessen
any
of
the
respect
I
owe
you
by
the
less
formal
approaches
I
desire
to
make
to
you
who
though
I
esteem
above
most
of
the
world
yet
I
love
yet
more

I
believe
ere
this
you
have
seen
the
new
Pompey
either
acted
or
written
and
then
will
repeat
your
partiality
to
the
others
but
I
wonder
much
what
preparations
for
it
could
prejudice
Will
Davenant
when
I
hear
they
acted
in
English
habits
and
that
so
a
propos
that
Cesar
was
sent
in
with
a
feather
and
a
staff
till
he
was
hissed
off
the
stage
and
for
the
scenes
I
do
not
see
where
they
could
place
any
that
are
very
extraordinary
but
if
this
play
has
not
diverted
the
citizens’
wives
enough
Sister
W.
D.
will
make
them
amends
for
they
say
Harry
the
8th
and
some
later
ones
are
little
better
than
puppet
plays

I
understand
the
confederate
translators
are
now
upon
Heraclins
and
I
am
contented
that
Sir
Thomas
Clarges
who
hath
done
that
last
year
should
adorn
this
triumph
in
it
as
I
have
done
in
Pompey
for
I
defy
Heraclius
and
all
his
works
having
so
unfortunately
piqued
Mr.
Waller
that
he
was
pleased
to
speak
of
me
with
as
little
generosity
to
the
King
as
he
once
did
of
Sacharissa
to
the
Parliament
and
I
fear
his
displeasure
is
no
wit
abated
since
the
King's
and
Queen's
so
gracious
reception
of
those
verses
you
mention
upon
her
majesty's
recovery
and
though
this
advantageous
opinion
might
have
given
me
some
vanity
yet
I'll
assure
you
Madam
yours
gave
me
more
and
though
I
never
wrote
anything
with
more
distrust
of
myself
that
since
you
think
them
worthy
of
so
favourable
a
mention
I
will
submit
my
judgement
to
you
and
rather
think
it
possible
that
I
might
hit
something
in
them
not
unluckily
than
that
you
could
be
unsincere
to
one
you
are
pleased
so
generously
to
own

You
see
how
much
I
depend
upon
what
you
say
and
therefore
you
ought
in
honour
never
to
use
me
with
compliment

I
am
glad
of
the
news
of
the
Duchess's
recovery
and
the
other
victory
you
mention
at
Court
for
though
it
be
but
changing
our
pack
of
cards
for
another
yet
time
and
inconstancy
together
may
at
last
fix
that
passion
where
it
ought
to
be

I
think
the
conquered
rival
has
done
well
in
the
change
of
her
principles
for
I
wonder
all
ladies
of
her
morality
are
not
of
a
religion
which
provides
them
so
many
shorter
ways
to
heaven
than
repentance
and
when
at
the
wane
of
their
fortune
they
may
retire
into
a
cloister
and
persuade
the
world
that
the
shame
of
their
disgrace
is
only
the
devotion
of
their
souls
and
so
make
a
virtue
of
necessity

I
know
you
have
goodness
and
generosity
enough
to
do
me
this
right
in
your
company
and
to
give
me
your
opinion
too
how
I
may
best
get
this
impression
suppressed
aud
myself
vindicated
and
therefore
I
will
not
beg
your
pardon
for
troubling
you
with
this
impertinent
story
nor
for
so
long
an
harangue
as
this
the
truth
is
I
would
fain
by
example
if
I
can
not
by
importunity
induce
you
to
that
freedom
which
is
begged
of
you
as
so
necessary
to
the
happiness
of
my
D
dear
Madam
Your
most
faithful
servant
ORINDA

To
Mr.
Temple
my
humble
service
I
beg

If
Madam
you
dislike
my
payment
of
two
letters
for
one
accuse
yourself
for
beginning
with
one
and
this
town
for
your
being
ill
entertained
for
if
that
would
punish
me
I
would
write
it
at
least
all
I
could
get
brought
to
me
for
though
I
am
not
sick
I
have
been
little
abroad
to
help
me

Your
sister
will
now
be
satisfied
her
intelligence
was
true
concerning
my
Lady
Harvie
for
I
suppose
she
knows
that
she
has
not
been
at
Court
since
the
King's
seeing
that
she
took
to
herself
represented
after
she
had
made
so
public
a
complaint
of
it
and
now
she
expects
some
favourable
expressions
from
his
Majesty
to
encourage
her
coming
again
but
yet
that
is
not
obtained
though
it
has
been
much
endeavoured
but
the
King
being
a
very
civil
person
and
she
having
a
mind
to
be
satisfied
the
business
will
probably
be
done

It is
a
dangerous
thing
I
find
for
Ladies
to
brag
of
power
in
State
affairs
and
I
am
confident
it
has
caused
that
to
be
done
that
would
not
have
been
to
any
other
gentlewoman

Her
brother
is
extremely
concerned
in
her
disgrace
which
has
been
now
a
great
while
to
satisfy
those
who
did
not
wish
her
in
favour

I
believe
nobody
is
unwilling
she
should
show
herself
in
the
drawingroom
the
Queen
has
taken
no
notice
of
this
business
except
very
privately

She
received
the
Portugal
envoy
very
coldly
that
brought
the
news
of
the
young
Princess
yet
she
says
now
the
Pope
has
confirmed
the
marriage
she
has
nothing
to
say

I
think
there
is
no
Prime
Minister
here
nor
any
great
favorite
those
who
have
had
most
have
so
still

What
will
be
done
with
my
Lady
of
Ormond
is
not
known
to
the
vulgar
but
guess
he
will
go
out
more
than
who
shall
come
in

The
Duchess
is
as
well
as
is
possible
and
has
as
fine
a
child
as
ever
was
seen

I
should
with
great
pleasure
send
the
news
of
the
Queen's
being
towards
her
condition

Mr.
Montague
goes
presently
my
Lady
Harry
Howard
will
go
no
further
than
Tangiers
till
he
knows
if
will
receive
him
well
My
Lady
Devonshire
was
used
with
such
great
respect
that
day
she

The

her
to

her
way

Some
would
have
cried
down
my

that

so

The

has
set
up
a
table
three
days
in
a
week
that
is

Sunday
the
King
at
my
Lord
Keepers
dismissed
the
Duke
of
Ormond
from
it
with
many
gracious
expressions
that
it
was
not
for
any
fault
or
miscarriages
of
his
governing
on
any
declination
of
his
kindness
to
his
person
which
he
would
show
by
taking
him
into
all
his
counsels
the
Duke
of
Ormond
made
a
long
speech
to
the
King
and
then
complimented
my
Lady
Roberts
which
he
more
than
returned
so
very
much
civility
past
since
he
attends
the
King
with
the
very
same
diligence
he
did
before
with
as
much
submission
and
humility
as
is
possible
and
severity
to
his
enemies

The
Duke
of
Buckingham
has
his
greatest
desire
in
his
being
out
but
not
all
it is
thought
because
he
did
not
choose
his
successor

On
Tuesday
the
King
dined
at
the
Dutch
Embassador's
they
will
all
treat
him
I
believe
and
none
worse
than
the
French
did
except
that
their
cooks
are
better
than
others
for
it was
as
poore
as
could
be
on
such
an
occasion
and
the
man
stood
at
the
door
taking
care
himself
of
his
plate
and
they
say
to
have
the
sweetnesses
saved
but

think
that
cannot

the
Maids

have
a
loss
by
it

it was
their

my

she
would

in
a
little
with
the
Duchess
of
Monmouth
again
so
far
as
to
see
her
sometimes

She
has
the
courage
only
to
resolve
to
have
her
hip
set
but
not
to
suffer
it
to
be
done
when
she
goes
about
it
makes
litle
trials

then
begs
of
them
to
let
her
alone

This
has
been
a
very
quarrelsome
week

the
King

Lord

his
duty
so
much
as
to
strike

was
in

case
not
to

what
he
did

he
is

the

and
Brunkard
and
Sir
John
Morton
were
so
high
in
words
in
the
Queen's
Privy
chamber

they

it

his

my
Lord
of
Devonshire
will
not
agree
he
can
endure
my
Lady

well
as
any

May
1668

If
it
is
true
that
we
are
generally
inclined
to
covet
what
we
admire
I
can
assure
you
my
ambition
aspires
not
to
the
fame
of
Balzac
and
therefore
must
not
thank
you
for
entitling
me
to
that
great
name

I
do
not
admire
his
style
nor
emulate
the
spirit
of
discontent
which
runs
through
all
his
letters

There
is
a
lucky
hit
in
reputation
which
some
obtained
by
the
defect
in
their
judges
rather
than
from
the
greatness
of
their
merit
the
contrary
may
be
instanced
in
Doctor
Donne
who
had
he
not
been
really
a
learned
man
a
libertine
in
wit
and
a
courtier
might
have
been
allowed
to
write
well
but
I
confess
in
my
opinion
with
these
qualifications
be
falls
short
in
his
letters
of
the
praises
some
give
him

Voyages
seems
to
excel
both
in
quickness
of
fancy
easiness
of
expression
&
in
a
facile
way
of
insinuating
that
he
was
not
ignorant
of
letters
an
advantage
the
court
air
gives
persons
who
converse
with
the
world
as
books

I
wonder
at
nothing
more
than
at
the
ambition
of
printing
letters
since
if
the
design
is
to
produce
wit
and
learning
there
is
too
little
scope
for
the
one
and
the
other
may
be
reduced
to
a
less
compass
than
a
sheet
of
gilt
paper
unless
truth
were
more
communicative

Businesses
love
accidents
secret
displeasure
family
intrigues
generally
makes
up
the
body
of
letters
and
can
signify
very
little
to
any
besides
the
persons
they
are
addressed
to
and
therefore
must
lose
infinitely
by
being
exposed
to
the
unconcerned

I
have
received
your
letter
and
request
for
a
supply
of
money
but
none
of
those
you
mention
which
were
bare
effects
of
your
duty

If
you
were
so
desirous
to
answer
our
expectations
as
you
pretend
to
be
you
would
give
those
tutors
and
overseers
you
think
so
exactly
over
you
less
trouble
than
I
fear
they
have
with
you

Much
is
to
be
wished
in
your
behalf
that
your
temper
was
humble
and
tractable
your
inclinations
virtuous
and
that
from
choice
not
compulsion
you
make
an
honest
man

Whatever
object
of
vice
comes
before
you
should
have
the
same
effect
in
your
mind
of
dislike
and
aversion
that
drunkenness
had
in
the
youth
of
Sparta
when
their
slaves
were
presented
to
them
in
that
brutish
condition
not
only
from
the
deformity
of
such
a
sight
but
from
a
motive
beyond
theirs
the
hope
of
a
future
happiness
which
those
rigorous
heathens
in
moral
virtue
had
little
prospect
of
finding
no
reward
for
virtue
but
in
virtue
itself

You
are
not
too
young
to
know
that
lying
defrauding
swearing
disobedience
to
parents
and
persons
in
authority
are
offences
to
God

that
debauchery
is
injurious
to
growth
health

and
indeed
to
the
pleasures
of

therefore
now
that
you

turning
from

to
man
endeavours
to

as
may

and
my

no
mark
of
it
shall
be
wanting
at
any
time
to
confirm
it
to
you
with
this
reserve
only
that
you
strive
to
deserve
kindness
by
a

Fallacies
will
only

When

considerations
I

will
apply

satisfaction

that

sad
accident
of
madam's
death

for
which
the

imaginable

very
ill

she
might
expect
from

the
worst
that
could

not
now
in
her
power
to
perform
what
he
expected
so
that

returning
to

immediately
carries
her
away
to

having

fifteen
days

good
health

morning

succoury

usually
took
upon
these
occasions

very

some
of
the
ladies
that
were
with

no

swallowed

succoury
water

8
hours
infinite
torment
in
her

most
lamented

in

been
in

I
will
not

doleful

Gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
Since
my
last
we
have
returned
the
bill
of
Commissioners
to
treat
with
the
Scotch
to
the
Lords
which
will
undoubtedly
pass

We
have
sent
them
up
this
morning
the
bill
for
prohibition
of
all
foreign
Brandy

which
though
it
goes
up
so
late
I
believe
will
pass
before
our
rising

The
City
bill
has
been
sent
down
with
many
alterations
which
yet
we
have
gone
thorough
&
agreed
to
except
in
one
point
which
they
will
certainly
concurred
in
and
may
be
reckoned
as
past

The
Lords
have
agreed
with
the
Bill
of
retrospect
upon
Brandy
to
pay
8
pence
since
1666

The
Lords
have
as
we
hear
thrown
out
that
part
of
our
bill
for
shipping
wherein
we
provided
against
men
of
war
trading
in
merchandise

Truly
in
an
ill
season
when
so
many
merchants
complain
and
the
Turks
take
prizes
in
our
Channel

Hereupon
the
house
being
disappointed
(
for
in
the
mean
while
he
was
escaped
by
the
back
door
ordered
that
door
to
be
nailed
up
for
the
future
have
revived
their
votes
of
63
against
all
paper
protections
against
protection
for
any
but
menial
servants
&c
&
to
day
after
a
long
debate
for
expelling
him
the
house
have
for
some
good
reasons
given
him
till
the
second
Tuesday
after
our
next
meeting
to
appear

When
that
will
be
is
not
yet
evident

Some
say
before
Midsummer
others
toward
Winter

But
however
I
hope
we
shall
rise
on
Monday
or
at
furthest
Tuesday

For
it
is
high
time
having
much
ado
to
get
forty
together
to
make
a
house
&
when
we
divided
about
the
Fee
farm
being
in
all
but

The
next
meeting
I
hope
will
be
better
attended

I

affectionate

I
should
not
question
yours
in
other
things
but
the
wisest
may
be
allowed
some
grains
and
I
conclude
you
no
less

courtier

a

my

that
the
most
refined
romance
I
ever
read
is
not
to
compare
with
it
love
is
made
so
pure
and
valour
so
nice
that
one
would
imagine
it
designed
for
a
Utopia
rather
then
our
stage

I
do
not
quarrel
with
the
poet
but
admire
once
born
in
the
decline
of
morality
should
be
able
to
feign
such
exact
virtue
and
as
poetic
fiction
has
been
instructive
in
former
ages
I
wish
this
the
same
event
in
ours

As
to
the
strict
law
of
comedy
I
dare
not
pretend
to
judge
some
think
the
division
of
the
story
not
as
well
as
if
it
could
all
have
been
comprehended
in
the
day’s
actions
truth
of
history
exactness
of
time
possibilities
of
adventures
are
nicest
the
ancient

Critics
might
require
but
those
who
have
outdone
them
in
fine
notions
may
be
allowed
the
liberty
to
express
them
their
own
way
and
the
present
world
is
so
enlightened
that
the
old
dramatic
must
bear
no
sways

This
account
perhaps
is
not
enough
to
do
Mr.
Dryden
right
yet
is
as
much
as
you
can
expect
from
the
leisure
of
one
who
has
the
care
of
a
nursery

We
may
not
reproach
our
own
since
here
is
at
this
present
a
scene
for
gallantry
and
merit
and
while
we
may
hope
we
must
not
condemn

Should
I
tell
you
how
full
of
sorrow
I
have
been
for
the
loss
of
Dr.
Bretton
you
only
would
blame
me
after
death
flattery
ceases
therefore
you
may
believe
there
was
some
cause
to
lament
when
thousands
of
weeping
eyes
witnessed
the
affliction
their
soles
were
in
one
would
have
imagined
every
one
in
this
parish
had
lost
a
father
brother
or
husband
so
great
was
the
bewailing
and
in
earnest
it
appears
there
has
never
been
a
better
nor
a
more
worthy
man

Such
was
his
temper
prudence
charity
and
good
conduct
that
he
gained
the
weak
and
preserved
the
wise

The
suddenness
of
his
death
was
a
surprise
only
to
his
friends
as
for
himself
it
might
be
looked
upon
as
a
deliverance
from
pain
the
effect
of
sickness
and
I
am
almost
persuaded
God
snatched
him
from
us
at
least
he
might
have
been
prevailed
with
by
the
number
of
petitions
to
leave
him
still
amongst
us

If
you
suspect
kindness
in
me
make
me
speak
too
much
Doctor
Parr
is
a
person
against
whom
you
cannot
object
it
was
him
who
preached
the
funeral
sermon
and
as
an
effect
of
truth
as
well
as
eloquence
he
himself
could
not
forbear
weeping
in
the
pulpit

It
was
his
own
expression
that
there
were
3
for
whom
he
had
infinitely
grieved
the
martyred
king
my
lord
Primate
and
doctor
Bretton
and
as
a
confirmation
of
the
right
that
was
done
him
in
that
oration
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
nor
a
dissenting
person

But
of
this

Should
I
confess
the
real
cause
it
is
your
expectation
of
extraordinary
notions
of
things
wholly
out
of
my
way
Women
were
not
born
to
ready
authors
and
censured
the
learned
to
compare
lives
and
judge
of
virtues
to
give
rules
of
morality
and
sacrifice
to
the
muses

We
are
willing
to
acknowledge
all
time
borrowed
from
family
duties
is
misspent
the
care
of
children's
education
observing
a
husband's
commands
assisting
the
sick
relieving
the
poor
and
being
serviceable
to
our
friends
are
of
sufficient
weight
to
employ
the
most
improved
capacities
among
us

If
sometimes
it
happens
by
accident
that
one
of
a
thousand
aspires
a
little
higher
her
fate
commonly
exposes
her
to
wonder
but
adds
little
to
esteem

The
distaff
will
defend
our
quarrels
as
well
as
the
sword
and
the
needle
is
as
instructive
as
the
pen

A
heroine
is
a
kind
of
prodigy
the
influence
of
a
blessing
star
is
not
more
dangerous
or
more
avoided

Though
I
have
lived
under
the
roof
of
the
learned
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
science
it
has
had
no
other
effect
on
such
a
temper
as
mine
but
that
of
admiration
and
that
too
but
when
it
is
reduced
to
practice

I
confess
I
am
infinitely
delighted
to
meet
within
books
the
achievements
of
the
heroes
with
the
calmness
of
philosophers
and
with
the
eloquence
of
orators
but
what
charms
me
irresistibly
is
to
see
perfect
resignation
in
the
minds
of
men
what
ever
happens
adverse
to
them
in
their
fortune
that
is
being
knowing
and
truly
wise
it
confirms
my
belief
of
antiquity
and
engages
my
persuasion
of
future
perfection
without
which
it
was
in
vain
to
live

Hope
not
for
volumes
or
treaties
raillery
may
make
me
go
beyond
my
bounds
but
when
serious
I
esteem
myself
capable
of
very
little
yet

am

Without
this
we
were

no

here
has

We
are

to
obtain
we

then
for
we
offend

though
in
compliance
to
your

of
things
I
could
joy
with
you

your

when

prove
to

that
are
left

your

I
do
rather
beg
of
you
cease
grieving
and
owe
that
to
reason
and
prudence
which
time
will
overcome

Was
I
in
so
good
health
that
I
could

I
would
be
daily
with
you

assure

how
much
I
am

Sir
If
a
friend
is
of
infinite
value
living
how
much
cause
has
we
to
lament
him
dead

Do
not
blame
me
if
I
believe
it
all
most
impossible
to
meet
with
a
person
so
worthy
in
himself
and
so
disposed
to
esteem
me
again
and
yet
that
is
not
the
chiefest
cause
of
my
affliction

I
might
wave
much
of
my
own
interest
had
I
not
so
many
partners
that
will
suffer
equally

These
are
the
trials
which
make
Christian
philosophy
useful
not
only
by
a
resignation
to
the
Divine
degree
but
by
that
hope
which
encourages
us
to
expect
a
more
lasting
happiness
than
any
this
world
can
give
without
which
we
were
extremely
wretched
since
no
felicity
here
has
any
duration

The
greatest
conquerors
themselves
are
subject
to
this
unsteady
state
of
human
nature
therefore
well
I
may
submit
whose
concerns
are
trivial
in
respect
of
others

Yet
this
I
conclude
that
we
die
by
degrees
when
our
friends
go
before
us

But
while
I
discuss
this
with
you
I
should
consider
what
effects
melancholy
reflections
may
have
on
a
splenetic
person
one
who
needs
not
cherish
that
temper

I
will
only
add
that
I
am
now
able
to
leave
my
chamber
which
is
more
than
I
could
do
these
14
days
and
that
I
am
Sir
Your
servant
M.
Evelyn

Madam
I
am
extremely
troubled
for
the
sickness
of
your
son
as
well
in
consideration
of
the
affliction
it
gives
you
as
the
dearness
I
have
for
him
myself
you
have
I
hear
done
me
the
favour
to
expect
me
long
in
the
country
where
I
intended
to
have
been
long
ago
but
court
affairs
are
more
hardly
solicited
now
than
ever
and
having
followed
them
till
I
had
spent
all
my
own
money
and
yours
too
I
was
forced
to
stay
something
longer
here
till
I
had
contrived
a
supply
which
being
now
dispatched
I
have
nothing
to
hinder
me
from
what
I
heartily
desire
which
is
to
wait
on
your
Ladyship
at
Adderbury
I
am
your
humble
servant
For

18
of
October
Wife
our
gut
has
already
been
griped
and
we
are
now
in
bed
so
that
we
are
not
in
a
condition
of
writing
either
according
to
thy
merit
or
our
desert
we
therefore
do
command
thy
benign
acceptance
of
these
our
letters
in
what
way
soever
by
us
inscribed
or
directed

thee
therewithal
to
assure
our
sole
daughter
and
heir
issue

Lady

And
if
you
have
a
grateful
heart
(
which
is
a
miracle
amongst
you
statesmen
show
it
by
directing
the
bearer
to
the
best
wine
in
town
and
pray
let
not
this
highest
point
of
sacred
friendship
be
performed
slightly
but
go
about
it
with
all
due
deliberation
and
care
as
holy
priests
to
sacrifice
or
as
discreet
thieves
to
the
wary
performance
of
burglary
and
about
you
travel
from
cellar
to
cellar
and
then
from
piece
to
piece
till
it
has
lighted
on
wine
fit
for
its
noble
choice
and
my
approbation

To
engage
you
the
more
in
this
matter
know
I
have
laid
a
plot
may
very
probably
betray
you
to
the
drinking
of
it

My
Lord
will
inform
you
at
large

Dear
Savile
as
ever
thou
do
hope
to
outdo
Machiavelli
or
equal
me
send
some
good
wine

So
may
thy
wearied
soul
at
last
find
rest
no
longer
hovering
'twixt
the
unequal
choice
of
politics
and
lewdness

May
thou
be
admired
and
loved
for
thy
domestic
wit
beloved
and
cherished
for
thy
foreign
interest
and
intelligence

Adderbury
Tuesday
the
8th
It is
not
the
least
of
my
happiness
that
I
think
you
love
me
but
the
first
of
all
my
pretensions
is
to
make
it
appear
that
I
faithfully
endeavour
to
deserve
it
if
there
be
a
real
good
upon
earth
'it is
in
the
name
of
friend
without
which
all
others
are
merely
fantastical
how
few
of
us
are
fit
stuff
to
make
that
thing
we
have
daily
the
melancholy
experience
however
dear
Harry
let
us
not
give
out
nor
despair
of
bringing
that
about
which
as
it
is
the
most
difficult
and
rare
accident
of
life
is
also
the
best
nay
perhaps
the
only
good
one
this
thought
has
so
entirely
possessed
me
since
I
came
into
the
country
(
where
only
one
can
think
for
you
at
court
think
not
at
all
or
at
least
as
if
you
were
shut
up
in
a
drum
you
can
think
of
nothing
but
the
noise
is
made
about
you
that
I
have
made
many
serious
reflections
upon
it
and
amongst
others
gathered
one
Maxim
which
I
desire
should
be
communicated
to
our
friend
Mr.
Guy
that
we
are
bound
in
morality
and
common
honesty
to
endeavour
after
competent
riches
since
it
is
certain
that
few
men
(
if
any
uneasy
in
their
fortunes
have
proved
firm
and
clear
in
their
friendships
a
very
poor
fellow
is
a
very
poor
friend
and
not
one
of
a
thousand
can
be
good
natured
to
another
who
is
not
pleased
within
himself
but
while
I
grow
into
proverbs
I
forget
that
you
may
impute
my
philosophy
to
the
dogdays
and
living
alone
to
prevent
the
inconveniences
of
solitude
and
many
others
I
intend
to
go
to
the
bath
on
Sunday
next
in
visitation
to
my
Lord
Treasurer
be
so
politic
or
be
so
kind
(
or
a
little
of
both
which
is
better
as
to
step
down
thither
if
famous
affairs
at
Windor
do
not
detain
you
dear
Harry
I
am
Your
hearty
faithful
affectionate
humble
servant

If
you
see
the
Dutch
of
P

I
have
therefore
sent
you
this
letter
to
prepare
you
for
a
remove
first
hither
and
afterwards
as
fate
shall
direct
which
is
(
I
find
the
true
disposer
of
things
whatever
we
attribute
to
wisdom
or
providence
be
therefore
in
a
readiness
upon
the
first
notice
from
me
to
put
that
in
execution
which
I
shall
first
inform
you
particularly
of
--
let
me
have
an
answer
and
dispatch
this
messenger
quickly

God
bless
you
yours
Rochester
These
for
the
C

of
Rochester
Dear
wife
I
received
your
three
pictures
and
am
in
a
great
fright
lest
they
should
be
like
you
by
the
bigness
of
the
head
I
should
apprehend
you
far
gone
in
the
Ricketts
by
the
severity
of
the
countenance
somewhat
inclined
to
prayer
and
prophesy
yet
there
is
an
alacrity
in
the
plump
cheek
that
seems
to
signify
sack
and
sugar
and
the
sharp
sighted
nose
has
borrowed
quickness
from
the
sweetsmelling
eye
I
never
saw
a
chin
smile
before
a
mouth
frown
and
a
forehead
mump
truly
the
artist
has
done
his
part
(
God
keep
him
humble
and
a
fine
man
he
is
if
his
excellencies
do
not
puff
him
up
like
his
pictures
the
next
impertinence
I
have
to
tell
you
is
that
I
am
coming
down
to
you
I
have
got
horses
but
want
a
coach
when
that
defect
is
supplied
you
shall
quickly
have
the
trouble
of
Your
humble
servant
Imminent
Peril
of
Sobriety
Present
my
duty
to
my
Lady
and
my
humble
service
to
my
sister
my
brother
and
all
the
babies
not
forgetting
Madam
Jane

Madam
I
am
at
last
come
to
Adderbury
where
I
find
none
but
the
housekeeper
the
butler
and
rats
who
squeak
mightily
and
are
all
in
good
health

Your
daughter
our
next-door
neighbour
is
well
I
gave
her
your
present
which
she
received
handsomely

Your
maids
for
good
husbandry
and
equipage
sake
I
would
have
sent
you
from
tithing
to
tithing
as
the
law
of
England
allows
but
Florence
was
gentle
and
penitent
and
deserves
something
better

I
have
given
her
counsel
for
one
end
and
a
soft
pillion
for
the
other
upon
which
she
ambles
to
Somersetshire
where
I
am
glad
to
hear
your
ladyship
is
I
hope
in
good
health
at
this
present
writing

Your
other
maid
is
a
very
eloquent
person
and
I
have
paid
her
wages

I
hope
my
brother
is
well
but
it
is
not
usual
to
present
our
service
to
men
in
ladies'
letters
so
like
a
wellbred
gentleman
I
rest
Madam
Your
humble
servant
Rochester

If
you
are
pleased
I
am
pleased
were
my
mother
pleased
all
were
pleased
which
God
be
pleased
to
grant

Rochester

Gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
This
has
been
the
third
day
that
the
House
of
Commons
has
been
upon
the
consideration
of
the
Leagues
with
Holland
and
what
depends
thereon

This
day
has
lasted
continual
sitting
till
nine
at
night
and
has
produced
these
three
votes
enclosed

There
is
a
general
apprehension
lest
the
Hollanders
have
already
made
their
conditions
with
France

I
must
beg
your
pardon
if
I
be
not
punctual
for
you
see
in
the
third
vote
that
upon
has
one
may
be
excused
even
from
using
the
formalities
due
to
the
Prince
much
more
will
you
dispense
with
gentlemen

affectionate

Yesterday
in
the
morning
they
adjourned
early
to
give
their
committee
time
till
three
in
the
afternoon
to
form
their
three
addresses

It
was
five
before
they
had
finished
and
first
they
reported
that
concerning
Duke
Lauderdale

The
debate
endured
till
toward
nine
at
night

The
House
was
twice
divided

152
against
151
and
then
afterwards
161
against
157

whereby
all
the
words
of
the
whole
address
were
thrown
but
so
that
there
remains
nothing
but
their
first
naked
vote

And
how
they
will
dispose
now
of
that
is
uncertain
for
it
being
late
the
House
adjourned
without
coming
to
any
further
resolution

The
apprehensions
of
the
Hollanders
closing
up
their
peace
with
France
do
still
continue
and
rather
increase
than
otherwise

To
the
Hull
Corporation
Gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
I
forgot
by
reason
of
my
hast
to
give
you
account
(
what
doubtless
you
have
known
from
other
hands
that
Sir
Rob
Sawyer
having
written
a
Letter
to
Mister
Golsbrough
Clerk
of
the
Commons
to
be
read
signifying
that
he
was
by
sickness
disabled
from
performing
his
place
and
Mister
Secretary
Williamson
informing
the
House
that
his
Majesty
gave
them
leave
to
choose
a
new
Speaker
Mister
Seymour
was
upon
Monday
last
chosen
Speaker
&
approved
at
the
Lords
bar
by
his
Majesty
in
the
usual
manner

Today
the
House
has
not
sate

Yesterday
in
the
morning
they
adjourned

Gentlemen
&c
Your
most
affectionate
servant
Andrew

There
was
no
counsel
yesterday

So
the
business
of
Angels’
lights
is
for
tomorrow

78

Gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
Yesterday
the
committee
appointed
for
that
purpose
made
their
report
of
this
addressee
enclosed

But
as
soon
as
it
was
made
several
gentlemen
moved
not
to
proceed
in
it
further
but
to
expect
some
information
more
of
the
resolutions
to
come
from
Holland

This
was
long
and
frequently
opposed
by
others

So
that
the
debate
terminated
in
a
division
of
the
House
the
most
numerous
that
I
remember
of
many
years
wherein
by
176
against
174
it
was
carried
to
proceed

The
second
of
169
against
166

Both
carried
in
the
affirmative

And
the
whole
address
as
I
send
it
you
was
agreed
and
the
members
of
the
Privy
Counsel
ordered
to
desire
of
his
Majesty
the
time
when
the
House
might
wait
upon
him
with
it

It
was
then
moved
that
the
Houses
vote
against
Duke
Lauderdale
that
his
Majesty
may
further
humbly
be
desired
to
remove
him
from
his
Counsels
and
presence
might
be
added
to
this
address
the
House
having
rejected
the
other
day
the
particular
form
in
which
it
was
drawn
up

This
admitting
a
debate
and
the
House
having
already
sat
the
whole
day
till
five
a
clock
some
moved
to
adjourn
which
came
at
last
to
be
the
question
and
the
House
being
divided
upon
it
it
was
carried
by
158
against
150
not
to
adjourn

So
they
proceeded
on
and
it
was
without
any
division
more
voted
to
add
him
to
the
address

It
happened
in
one
of
the
former
divisions
that
on
some
occasion
in
the
lobby
there
were
blows
given
between
Sir
Thomas
Chichley
Master
of
the
Ordinance
and
the
Lord
Obrian
though
both
of
the
same
party

The
House
ordered
Sir
Thomas
who
was
present
and
the
Lord
Obrian
who
absented
to
be
taken
into
custody
of
their
sergeant
at
arms

Both
were
avoided
by
the
question
whether
the
debate
should
be
adjourned
which
past
by
168
against
167
in
the
negative
and
so
fell

They
with
their
address
waited
since
on
the
King
who
seemed
dissatisfied

God
grant
better

I
am
your
servant
Andrew
Marvell

Gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
I
have
very
little
subject
of
writing
the
present
business
of
parliament
having
been
all
concluded
yesterday
morning

For
his
Majesty
sent
up
for
the
Commons
to
the
House
of
Lords
and
prorogued
the
parliament
till
the
twenty
third
of
this
month

You
know
that
always
upon
prorogation
whatsoever
business
was
imperfect
and
depending
is
quite
cut
off
and
if
the
parliament
intend
to
proceed
again
upon
it
they
must
resume
all
from
the
very
beginning

One
thing
you
may
please
to
take
notice
of
that
the
cornclause
is
by
the
period
of
this
session
expired

I
doubt
not
but
many
will
reflect
upon
this
prorogation
for
other
reasons

But
they
that
discourse
the
lest
and
think
the
best
of
it
will
be
the
wisest
men
and
the
best
subjects

God
in
mercy
direct
his
Majesty
always
to
that
which
may
most
conduce
to
his
own
and
the
Kingdom’s
happiness

I
remain
gentlemen
etc.
Your
most
affectionate
servant
Andrew
Marvell
Westminster
May

14

1678

Gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
His
Majesty
opened
this
session
with
the
speech
which
I
send
you
enclosed

And
after
that
the
Lord
Chancellor
spoke
at
large
but
the
copy
of
it
not
having
been
communicated
to
the
House
of
Commons
they
appointed
a
committee
to
peruse
the
Lords
Journal
for
it
where
such
things
are
of
course
to
be
entered

The
rest
of
their
time
was
spent
in
settling
the
ordinary
affairs
of
their
House
appointing
days
for
their
grand
committees
naming
and
empowering
their
committee
of
privileges
and
renewing
the
clause
against
bribery
or
entertainments
in
order
to
elections
and
lastly
in
receiving
several
petitions
concerning
undue
elections

What
I
remark
in
the
House
is
that
it
is
much
fuller
than
ordinary
and
more
are
still
upon
the
road
and
there
seems
a
more
than
usual
concernment
among
all
men
as
if
some
great
and
I
hope
good
thing
were
to
be
expected

God
in
his
mercy
direct
all
to
the
best

What
I
understand
thereof
I
shall
from
time
to
time
communicate
to
you
remaining
gentlemen
etc.
Your
most
affectionate
servant

Andrew

1678
Gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
The
House
of
Commons
not
having
the
Chancellor's
speech
that
day
printed
or
written
sat
(
I
mean
yesterday
not
long
nor
did
much
work

The
bill
for
encouragement
of
the
woollen
manufacture
which
was
in
progress
last
session
was
read
the
first
time

They
also
appointed
a
committee
to
bring
in
a
bill
or
bills
to
hinder
the
growth
of
Popery

Today
(
which
was
intended
though
not
ordered
for
consideration
of
his
Majesty’s
and
the
Chancellor’s
speech
but
the
morning
being
most
part
spent
before
the
speeches
were
published
there
was
a
motion
made
for
an
humble
address
to
his
Majesty
to
know
of
him
the
state
of
affairs
as
they
now
stand
in
relation
to
war
or
peace
and
that
if
his
Majesty
shall
think
fit
to
enter
into
a
war
with
the
French
King
with
the
assistance
of
the
Emperor
and
such
other
Princes
and
states
as
shall
come
into
the
confederacy
this
House
will
support
and
assist
his
Majesty
in
the
carrying
on
the
war

xxxThis
debate
took
up
the
whole
day
forasmuch
as
some
counted
this
address
to
be
unseasonable
when
it
appeared
that
all
things
abroad
were
so
disposed
toward
a
peace
some
thought
it
more
requisite
to
proceed
first
of
all
to
the
disbanding
of
the
army
others
that
it
were
best
to
lay
by
all
apprehensions
and
jealousies
and
to
furnish
the
King
with
money
leaving
the
rest
to
his
Majesty's
discretion

In
this
variety
of
opinions
the
House
came
about
four
a
clock
to
a
question
of
adjourning
the
debate
which
was
carried
in
the
affirmative
by
195
against
176

In
general
what
I
learn
by
information
both
within
and
without
doors
is
that
both
Holland
and
Spain
appear
to
be
agreed
upon
terms
with
France

I
have
enclosed
the
speeches

I
remain
gentlemen
etc.
Your
most
affectionate
servant

June
18.78

Gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
Yesterday
the
House
of
Commons
past
the
bill
for
exportation
of
leather
and
sent
it
up
to
the
Lords

Next
upon
division
of
149
to
142

That
it
appears
that
40000
pounds
has
been
borrowed
on
the
excise
and
expended
for
the
extraordinary
charge
of
the
ordinance
in
the
year
1677

Today
being
the
last
on
which
any
new
motion
could
be
made
for
supply
his
Majesty
commanded
the
House
to
wait
on
him
in
the
House
of
Lords
when
he
spoke
long
to
them
but
it
has
been
impossible
for
me
to
send
you
a
copy
of
the
speech
the
House
having
sat
all
day
till
seven
in
the
evening

But
the
most
remarkable
point
was
that
his
Majesty
desired
beside
these
supplies
already
in
prospect
to
be
further
furnished
with
an
additional
revenue
for
his
life
of
300000
pounds
a
year
on
which
condition
he
would
appropriate
500000
pounds
a
year
to
the
navy

Also
40000
pounds
for
the
Princess
of
Orange's
portion

And
signified
there
might
be
a
recess
toward
the
middle
of
the
next
month

They
first
voted
thanks
to
be
presented
by
the
Privy
Counsel
for
the
gracious
expressions
in
his
speech

Then
after
long
debate
they
voted
without
trying
the
division
that
they
would
not
go
into
committee
of
the
House
for
raising
a
revenue
of
300000
pounds
a
year
for
his
Majesty's
life

But
next
to
go
tomorrow
into
a
committee
of
the
whole
House
to
consider
of
the
motion
for
continuing
the
imposition
on
wines
as
also
of
the
way
of
raising
the
200000
pounds
to
which
they
are
obliged
and
the
other
2
or
300000
pounds
for
the
charge
of
this
fleet
and
to
consider
the
motion
for
40000
pounds
portion

From
hence
these
things
being
thus
settled
they
entered
into
a
great
debate
of
looking
into
the
Privy
Seals
for
secret
service
since
1
of
May
77

and
of
taking
account
what
pensions
on
the
revenue

And
then
of
a
test
for
the
members
that
they
had
not
been
bribed
and
a
great
many
heads
more

It was
late
but
carried
not
to
adjourn
by
173
against
103

Then
at
last
the
question
was
put
for
a
committee
to
draw
up
such
a
test

It
fell
by
a
division
of
100
to
86

I
remain
gentlemen
etc.
Your
most
affectionate
servant
Andrew
Marvell

The
House
sat
the
most
part
of
the
day
in
committee
of
the
whole
House
upon
the
matters
of
supply
which
I
mentioned
formerly

And
in
conclusion
they
agreed
(
not
reckoning
in
the
200000
pounds
already
past
for
the
disbanding
the
army
that
in
discharge
of
the
200000
pounds
borrowed
on
the
excise
and
of
the
extraordinary
charge
of
the
fleet
and
for
the
payment
of
40000
pounds
for
the
Princess
of
Orange’s
portion
there
should
be
in
all
414000
pounds
more
raised

But
of
the
way
of
levying
it
there
is
yet
nothing
resolved
though
several
things
were
propounded

Today
the
bill
for
wearing
of
woollen
and
that
against
Papists
sitting
in
either
House
of
Parliament
were
both
reported
and
ordered
to
be
engrossed

They
should
have
went
then
again
into
committee
about
the
way
of
raising
this
money
but
the
Lords
having
sent
down
the
disbanding
bill
with
some
amendments
diverted
it

The
Lords
have
altered
the
last
of
June
which
the
Commons
had
fixed
for
disbanding
all
the
forces
except
those
in
Flanders
to
the
27th
of
July
and
given
those
in
Flanders
a
further
term
as
I
remember
to
the
24th
of
August

The
debate
did
principally
run
upon
the
27th
of
July
and
the
Commons
have
voted
that
they
disagree
and
have
ordered
a
committee
to
prepare
reasons
of
this
disagreement
to
be
presented
to
the
Lords
at
a
conference

They
have
resolved
also
to
sit
on
Monday
although
it
is
a
holiday
being
very
intent
to
dispatch
all
business
as
soon
as
possible
for
many
members
go
daily
away
and
all
here
are
weary

I
remain
gentlemen
etc.
Your
most
affectionate
servant
Andrew
Marvell

Gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
Since
my
last
the
bill
for
wearing
of
woollen
has
been
read
the
third
time
past
and
sent
up
to
the
Lords

Also
the
bill
for
continuing
the
new
impost
upon
wines
and
vinegars
has
been
read
the
first
time

There
was
moreover
a
bill
brought
into
day
and
once
read
for
supplying
certain
defects
in
the
French
prohibition
explaining
the
ships
to
be
subject
to
seizure
which
fraudulently
put
in
to
ports
and
lie
there
without
apparent
necessity
and
making
the
informers
part
more
certain
and
easy
to
come
by
etc.
They
sent
also
by
some
of
their
members
to
a
conference
with
the
Lords
about
the
disbanding
bill
a
provision
which
they
desired
might
in
lieu
of
the
Lords’
amendments
be
added
to
the
bill
whereby
in
case
any
part
of
the
army
cannot
be
disbanded
by
the
last
of
this
month
there
may
be
more
time
allowed
so
that
the
whole
do
not
exceed
the
terms
in
the
bill
above
30
days

I
hear
that
the
Lords
are
likely
although
it
comes
so
near
to
their
own
sense
yet
to
disagree
in
it

The
House
of
Commons
have
both
today
and
yesterday
been
in
committee
about
the
way
of
raising
the
other
moneys

After
several
debates
concerning
200000
pounds
to
be
raised
on
the
new
foundations
since
1656
within
ten
miles
of
London
of
making
a
second
act
for
review
of
the
pollbill
of
laying
a
further
tax
upon
land
the
House
has
at
last
resolved
(
agreeing
with
the
committee
that
the
414000
pounds
and
no
more
shall
be
raised
by
the
old
way
of
subsidy

And
they
have
appointed
to
go
again
tomorrow
into
committee
in
order
to
the
further
consideration
of
that
method
and
toward
preparing
the
bill
for
that
purpose

June
11
1679

D.S

You
may
remember
I
wrote
unto
you
some
weeks
since
concerning
a
gentleman
Mr.
Austine
Blennerhaysett
commonly
called
Mr.
Hayset
or
Hasset
his
business
has
hindered
his
journey
then
intended

But
he
intends
God
willing
to
be
in
London
on
Tuesday
next

I
presume
you
have
my
letter
which
I
then
wrote
pray
peruse
it
and
know
that
he
says
he
has
had
some
gleeting
at
the
penis
at
times
a
great
while
he
came
about
Michaelmas
last
to
Dr
Blincolne
and
myself
and
he
took
some
mercurial
medicines
and
decoctions
and
diet
drinks
and
grew
well
as
he
said
only
I
understand
from
him
that
he
is
not
free
from
gleeting
sometimes
and
also
has
some
inability
as
to
erection

Therefore
I
would
have
you
to
view
the
penis
diligently
and
you
may
also
take
in
my
cousin
Hobbs
he
will
stay
about
3
weeks
if
thought
fit
for
the
use
of
any
medicines
or
course

He
intends
to
marry
and
has
settled
affection
upon
a
good
gentlewoman
and
is
in
a
manner
agreed
but
it
were
fit
he
should
be
in
such
a
state
of
body
as
might
be
safe
and
congruous
unto
both

Consider
therefore
well
of
it
and
do
all
with
the
best
secrecy
possible
for
he
is
very
jealous
and
apt
to
be
meticulous
and
is
hypochondriac

Some
additions
would
be
made
I
wrote
one
to
you
concerning
Hippocrates
that
he
practised
in
Thessalie
and
mentions
divers
patients
of
Larissa
and
therefore
look
out
that
paper
and
if
you
have
lost
it
give
me
notice
for
that
is
a
material
observation
especially
unto
physicians
and
scholars

It’s
an
odd
passage
concerning
the
French
King’s
getting
Savoy
and
Piedmont
into
his
hand
for
money
and
it
will
concern
many
states
and
make
them
look
about
them

Though
he
had
a
good
army
yet
its
thought
he
has
prevailed
much
by
his
money
in
all
the
war
and
current
of
his
affairs

The
rising
in
Scotland
falls
out
unhappily
at
this
time
many
will
wish
that
the
parliament
were
sitting
but
some
jealous
people
will
think
that
this
may
rather
hinder
their
sitting

I
am
glad
the
business
succeeded
so
well
at
Halstead
in
Kent

Miles
about
London
are

Joseph

Lord
Townshend

is
a
parliament
man
but
of
the
West
country
and
about
Bristowe

I
knew
well
one
Mr.
Abraham
Ashe
who
was
a
Russia
merchant
who
died
near
30
years
since
perhaps
he
might
be
related
unto
this
family
it
was
a
good
FRrencountre
to
meet
with
Mr.
Ash
who
had
travelled
in
those
parts
which
you
have
described
and
if
he
had
read
them
might
have
been
some
light
and
information
unto
them

1679
Dear
son
I
heard
that
some
ships
passed
by
Yarmouth
with
soldiers
in
them
for
Scotland
6
or
7
days
past
and
the
coffee
and
common
news
letters
tell
us
something
of
the
rebellion
in
Scotland
but
I
think
very
imperfectly

A
little
more
time
will
better
inform
us
of
that
business
and
they
are
like
to
be
more
effectually
dealt
with
and
brought
to
reason
by
the
English
forces
when
there
shall
be
a
sufficient
number
of
them
in
Scotland
for
the
rebels
hope
and
others
doubt
whether
those
of
their
nation
will
fight
heartily
against
them
for
its
said
there
are
more
discontented
in
Scotland
than
those
yet
in
arms
so
that
this
may
be
a
coal
not
so
soon
quenched
though
it
was
begun
by
the
lowest
Scots
yet
the
Scots
are
very
tenacious
of
the
protestant
religion
and
have
entertained
fears
and
jealousies
of
designs
to
introduce
the
Roman
from
their
observation
of
the
affairs
in
England
and
are
not
like
to
be
quieted
long
without
a
parliament
and
if
that
should
be
broke
of
to
their
discontent
they
would
be
contriving
again
and
the
English
parliaments
would
be
but
cold
in
suppressing
them

When
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
gives
a
farther
account
we
may
see
farther
into
the
business

When
the
weather
proves
cold
and
fit
for
dissections
if
you
have
opportunity
take
notice
of
a
bear
its
commonly
said
that
a
bear
has
no
breast
bone
and
that
he
cannot
well
run
down
a
hill
his
heart
will
so
come
up
toward
his
throat

This
day
one
came
to
show
me
a
book
and
to
sell
it
it
was
a
hortus
hyemalis
in
a
book
made
at
Padua
but
I
had
seen
it
above
thirty
years
ago
and
it
contains
not
many
plants

You
had
a
very
good
one
or
two
if
you
have
not
parted
with
them

and

Dear
Son
I
was
very
glad
to
receive
your
last
letter

God
has
heard
our
prayers
and
I
hope
will
bless
you
still

I
thought
myself
rich
enough
till
my
children
grew
up

Be
careful
of
yourself
and
temperate
that
you
may
be
able
to
go
through
your
practise
for
to
attain
to
the
getting
of
a
thousand
pounds
a
year
requires
no
small
labour
of
body
and
mind
and
is
a
life
not
much
less
painful
and
laborious
than
that
of
the
meaner
sort
of
people
go
through

When
you
put
out
your
money
be
well
assured
of
the
assurance
and
be
wise
therein
from
what
your
father
has
suffered

It
is
laudable
to
dwell
handsomely
but
be
not
to
forward
to
build
or
set
forth
another
man’s
house
or
so
to
fill
it
that
it
may
increase
the
fuel
if
God
should
please
to
send
fire

The
merciful
God
direct
you
in
all

Excess
in
apparel
and
chargeable
dresses
are
got
into
the
country
especially
among
women
men
go
decently
and
plain
enough

The
last
assizes
there
was
a
concourse
of
women
at
that
they
call
my
Lord’s
garden
in
Cunsford
and
so
richly
dressed
that
some
strangers
said
there
was
scarce
the
like
to
be
seen
at
Hide
park
which
makes
charity
cold

We
now
bear
that
this
parliament
shall
sit
the
21
of
October
which
will
make
London
very
full
in
Michaelmas
term

I
have
read
all
or
most
of
Dr
Love's
book
which
is
a
pretty
book
and

For

in

Court

these
London
Dear
son
Mr.
Feltham
has
been
so
taken
up
with
his
kindred
and
a
journey
to
Yarmouth
and
I
have
been
often
at
Sprowston
that
we
have
not
had
the
opportunity
to
be
so
civil
unto
him
and
his
friends
as
we
desired
and
intended

I
was
glad
to
see
him
and
wish
him
all
prosperity
both
for
his
own
sake
and
of
his
parents
my
loving
friends
and
acquaintance

His
father
was
a
cordial
and
very
loving
friend
of
mine
and
his
mother
a
very
good
women
unto
whom
we
recommend
as
many
as
we
can
and
his
2
sisters
in
Norwich
are
very
good
women

I
am
glad
Sir
William
went
to
London
for
he
would
find
an
uncomfortable
house
at
Sprowston
where
there
are
and
have
been
so
many
sick
as
I
doubt
not
but
my
L.
Adams
has
informed
Sir
William

I
hope
Mr.
Adams
is
much
better

My
service
to
Sir
William

Madame
Burwell
has
been
better
this
day
but
these
diseases
are
most
dangerous
unto
persons
in
years

God
bless
you

gone

Mr.
Feltham
told
me
he
had
but
ill
success
in
one
operation
when
yourself
and
Mr.
Feltham
were
present

I
am
glad
you
have
so
good
hopes
of
Mrs.
Tye
pray
remember
my
service
unto
her
at
your
opportunity

She
is
of
an

doubtless
you
may
meet
with
some
good
observations
therein

I
have
not
as
yet
seen
it

You
may
take
good
notice
of
what
he
says
therein
for
you
cannot
choose
but
meet
with
many
questions
from
women
with
child
but
it is
little
to
be
questioned
that
the
book
you
read
of
the
projection
at
Vienna
and
the
history
of
it
will
find
many
readers
for
the
like
has
not
been
written
where
the
powder
has
been
put
to
sale
and
so
the
verity
thereof
been
so
subject
unto
trial

Madame
Burwell
has
yet
some
distempered
nights

I
am
glad
you
can

my
L.M

of
Dorchester
when
you
go
to
him

You
have
surely
much
obliged
him
by
his
last
recovery

my

you
all

Tom
was
ill
last
week
but
upon

Dear
Son
My
cousin
Cradock
went
suddenly
away
so
that
I
could
not

him
at
my

I
intended

more

will

that
there
is

that

many

will
not
be
without
it

I
should
be
glad
to
see
the

read
it
for
I
doubt
it
is
not
at

as

For

Salisbury

these

golden
balls
London
To
Lady
Tuke

April
1685

How
to
express
the
sorrow
for
parting
with
so
dear
a
child
is
a
difficult
task

She
was
welcome
to
me
from
the
first
moment
God
gave
her
acceptable
through
the
whole
course
of
her
life
by
a
thousand
endearments
by
the
gifts
of
nature
by
acquired
parts
by
the
tender
love
she
ever
showed
her
father
and
me
a
thread
of
piety
accompanied
all
her
actions
and
now
proves
out
greatest
consolation

The
patience
resignation
humility
of
her
carriage
in
so
severe
and
fatal
a
disease
discovered
more
than
an
ordinary
assistance
of
the
divine
goodness
never
expressing
fear
of
death
or
a
desire
to
live
but
for
her
friends
sake

The
seventh
day
of
her
illness
she
discoursed
to
me
in
particular
as
calmly
as
in
health
desired
to
confess
and
receive
the
blessed
sacrament
which
she
performed
with
great
devotion
after
which
thought
in
her
perfect
senses
to
the
last
she
never
signified
the
least
concern
for
the
world
prayed
often
and
resigned
her
sole.—
What
shall
I
say

She
was
too
great
a
blessing
for
me
who
never
deserved
anything
much
less
such
a
jewel

What
are
the
charms
that
keep
our
minds
in
suspense

Without
the
conversation
of
those
we
love
what
is
life
worth

How
did
I
propose
happiness
this
summer
in
the
return
of
your
Ladyship
and
my
dear
child
—
for
she
was
absent
almost
all
this
winter

She
had
much
improved
herself
by
the
remarks
she
had
made
of
the
world
and
all
its
vanities
—
what
shall
I
add

I
could
always
speak
of
her
and
might
I
be
just
to
her
without
suspicion
of
partiality
could
tell
you
many
things

The
papers
which
are
found
in
her
cabinet
discover
she
profited
by
her
reading
such
reflections
collections
out
of
scripture
confessions
meditations
and
pious
notions
evidence
her
time
was
not
spent
in
the
trifling
way
of
most
young
women

I
acknowledge
as
a
Christian
I
ought
not
to
murmur
and
I
should
be
infinitely
sorry
to
incur
God's
further
displeasure

There
are
those
yet
remaining
that
challenge
my
care
and
for
their
sakes
I
endeavour
to
submit
a
for
her
kind
concern
and
wish
she
may
live
to
be
the
comfort
you
deserve
in
her
that
God
will
continue
the
blessing
to
both
and
make
you
happy
which
is
the
prayer
of
her
who
is
Yours
most
affectionately
Mary
Evelyn

For
after
all
that
you
do
or
can
say
in
magnifying
this
essay
of
mine
I
must
consider
it
as
but
a
faint
offer
at
some
kind
of
acknowledgement
for
your
favours
and
I
beseech
you
to
receive
it
as
such
from
one
who
wishes
for
nothing
more
than
the
of
opportunities
of
showing
how
sensible
he
is
of
them

Upon
this
confidence
and
the
good
success
you
assure
me
our
method
has
hitherto
had
I
venture
to
trouble
you
with
the
remainder
of
my
thoughts
on
that
subject
and
in
this
one
more
long
sheet
you
will
find
I
am
come
to
the
end
of
my
tether

For
having
conducted
my
young
master
to
the
age
when
he
will
be
got
out
of
the
hands
of
masters
and
tutors
we
are
at
the
bounds
of
what
is
said
to
concern
education

I
do
not
pretend
though
I
am
now
come
to
the
conclusion
that
I
have
given
you
a
just
treatise
on
this
matter

There
are
a
thousand
other
things
that
may
need
consideration
especially
if
one
should
take
in
the
various
tempers
different
inclinations
and
particular
defaults
that
are
to
be
found
in
children
and
prescribe
proper
remedies
to
each
of
them

But
in
this
tumultuary
draft
I
have
made
for
your
son
I
have
considered
him
barely
as
white
paper
as
a
piece
of
wax
to
be
moulded
and
fashioned
and
therefore
have
only
touched
those
heads
which
I
judged
necessary
to
the
breeding
of
a
young
gentleman
of
his
condition
in
general

And
though
I
have
with
a
great
deal
of
freedom
given
you
my
opinion
concerning
all
those
things
that
came
in
my
thoughts
and
appeared
material
yet
I
am
too
sensible
of
my
want
of
experience
in
this
affair
and
the
oversights
I
am
liable
to
to
think
that
I
have
writ
approaches
anything
more
perfect
even
in
that
kind

You
must
not
therefore
though
I
am
come
to
the
end
look
on
it
as
a
treatise
which
I
put
into
your
hands
for
complete

For
since
I
shall
not
scruple
to
trouble
you
with
anything
else
on
this
subject
which
may
at
any
time
hereafter
come
into
my
thoughts
you
may
be
sure
I
shall
much
more
readily
do
so
when
you
shall
set
me
on
work
or
propose
any
new
matter
you
shall
find
wanting
which
your
care
and
concern
for
your
dear
little
ones
cannot
(
I
conclude
fail
to
suggest
to
you
in
abundance
it
being
a
fate
that
usually
attends
the
speculations
which
contemplative
men
have
pleased
themselves
with
in
their
studies
to
be
found
very
defective
when
they
come
to
be
put
in
practice

As
to
remedies
for
peculiar
disorders
the
account
you
give
me
of
your
son
makes
me
think
I
shall
have
little
to
say
on
that
occasion

You
will
not
suspect
I
flatter
you
when
I
say
his
temper
is
as
one
could
wish
and
the
love
of
reason
he
shows
in
his
inquiries
and
discourses
is
as
much
to
be
preferred
to
that
prattling
quickness
which
we
are
apt
to
be
delighted
in
with
children
as
a
healthy
well-made
boy
is
to
a
gaudy
suit
and
if
it
were
necessary
there
I
think
I
could
show
you
that
that
witty
pertness
that
appears
sometimes
so
early
proceeds
from
a
principle
that
seldom
accompanies
a
strong
constitution
of
body
or
ripens
into
a
strong
judgement
of
mind

And
if
you
desire
to
have
him
a
more
brisk
talker
I
believe
I
could
teach
you
the
way
to
make
him
so

But
I
find
you
had
rather
your
son
should
be
able
and
useful
when
a
man
the
pretty
company
and
diversion
to
others
whilst
a
child
though
if
that
too
were
to
be
considered
I
think
I
may
say
there
is
not
so
much
pleasure
to
have
a
child
prattle
agreeably
as
to
reason
well

Encourage
therefore
his
inquisitiveness
all
you
can
by
satisfying
his
demands
and
inform
his
judgement
as
far
as
it
is
capable

When
his
reasons
are
any
way
tolerable
let
him
find
the
credit
and
commendation
of
it

and
when
they
are
quite
out
of
the
way
let
him
without
being
laughed
at
for
his
mistake
be
gently
put
into
the
right
and
can
take
care
as
much
as
you
can
that
in
this
inclination
he
shows
to
reason
about
everything
nobody
balk
or
impose
upon
him

I
now
add
that
if
it
be
possible
you
should
get
it
with
pictures
which
will
in
a
temper
like
his
(
that
if
I
mistake
not
is
much
more
pleased
with
things
than
names
make
the
learning
of
characters
and
words
go
down
much
easier
when
he
sees
there
is
some
use
of
it
and
that
the
knowledge
of
beasts
and
birds
and
such
other
things
comes
along
with
it
those
visible
objects
children
heard
talked
of
in
vain
and
without
any
satisfaction
whilst
that
have
no
ideas
of
them

If
therefore
Æsop‘s
Fables
or
some
such
other
book
cannot
be
got
with
pictures
yet
at
least
get
him
what
pictures
of
animals
you
can
with
the
names
of
them
which
at
the
same
time
will
encourage
him
to
read
and
afford
him
matter
of
enquiry
and
knowledge

If
you
find
it
with
difficulty
to
meet
with
such
a
tutor
as
we
desire
I
do
not
at
all
wonder

I
can
only
say
spare
no
care
nor
cost
to
get
such
an
one

All
things
are
to
be
had
that
way
and
I
dare
assure
you
that
if
you
get
a
good
one
you
will
never
repent
the
charge
but
you
will
always
have
the
satisfaction
to
think
it
the
money
of
all
others
the
best
laid
out

But
be
sure
take
nobody
upon
friends
or
charitable
no
nor
great
commendations

Inform
yourselves
thoroughly
whether
he
be
for
your
purpose
and
when
you
find
him
every
way
so
get
him
at
any
rate

But
whether
he
be
such
an
one
as
I
have
formerly
mentioned
and
your
design
will
need
you
alone
can
judge
nor
will
the
reputation
of
a
sober
man
with
learning
enough
(
which
with
others
is
all
usually
that
is
required
in
a
tutor
serve
your
turn

When
I
consider
the
scruples
and
cautions
I
here
lay
in
your
way
methinks
it
looks
as
if
I
advised
you
to
something
which
I
would
have
you
offer
at
but
in
effect
not
do

but
you
know
how
much
I
am
in
earnest
in
this
point
only
you
will
understand
me
aright
if
you
think
it
a
business
you
ought
to
be
very
nice
in

When
you
have
pitched
on
one
after
having
had
him
awhile
with
you
tell
me
what
kind
of
a
man
he
is
I
will
then
the
best
I
can
tell
you
what
kind
of
use
you
are
to
make
of
him

As
to
the
business
with
Stratton
I
have
nothing
to
say
but
leave
it
wholly
to
your
judgement
for
so
as
you
determine
I
know
it
will
be
well

Present
my
humble
service
to
Madam
and
tell
her
I
am
glad
the
little
ones
follow
so
well
the
footsteps
of
their
mother
that
they
begin
to
have
a
reputation
so
early

I
wish
her
and
them
health
that
she
may
long
enjoy
that
growing
satisfaction

I
wish
you
with
them
all
happiness
and
am
Sir
your
most
humble
servant
J.L

15th
march

But
to
enter
into
a
dispute
with
you
wherein
an
excess
of
friendship
makes
you
obstinate
I
have
another
reason
to
suspect
that
your
consideration
for
the
person
that
gave
it
makes
you
overlook
many
things
in
the
advice
itself
since
that
I
receive
not
from
you
any
objections
about
any
part
of
it

For
though
I
must
own
it
is
according
to
the
best
of
my
skill
and
though
I
know
the
affection
I
writ
it
with
to
be
very
sincere
yet
I
can
by
no
means
fancy
my
opinion
infallible
or
that
it
should
in
all
things
so
exactly
jump
with
yours
and
madam's
that
you
should
find
nothing
(
in
what
is
already
put
in
practice
to
be
added
omitted
or
altered
whereof
however
you
say
nothing
at
all

For
I
doubt
not
but
when
I
revise
the
foul
copy
which
I
keep
by
me
on
purpose
I
shall
myself
find
occasion
for
additions
or
alterations

I
do
not
at
all
wonder
that
you
have
not
yet
found
a
tutor
to
your
mind
and
I
confess
the
truth
somewhat
pleased
with
it

Not
that
you
are
hitherto
disappointed
but
that
I
perceive
that
you
are
more
curious
in
your
choice
than
to
take
up
a
venture
with
the
first
or
second
that
comes
in
your
way

It is
of
great
consequence
to
your
son
and
therefore
you
cannot
be
too
nice
in
it

If
you
could
get
your
cousin
to
Chipley
a
sober
well
conditioned
young
man
with
moderate
learning
would
do
the
business
but
you
know
his
humour
and
how
averse
to
trouble
especially
of
some
kind

But
as
to
the
law
suit
I
mentioned
in
my
last
I
conclude
upon
second
thoughts
that
it
is
best
to
let
it
perfectly
alone
without
meddling
at
all
in
it
any
farther
than
Earl
Pembroke
himself
shall
of
his
own
accord
discourse
of
his
own
concerns
and
give
his
advice
about
it
and
then
it
would
perhaps
be
not
amiss
to
enquire
and
reason
with
him
for
your
own
satisfaction
of
the
grounds
he
proceeds
on

For
example
the
key
put
in
at
the
keyhole
a
must
be
turned
by
b-c-d
quite
to
b
again
and
from
b
be
turned
back
again
to
d
and
there
let
stand
and
then
the
lid
of
the
chest
may
be
lifted
up

This
I
am
sure
is
the
just
quantity
of
the
motion
that
the
key
must
have
and
I
think
for
making
it
you
must
begin
the
motion
with
the
sun
but
this
I
do
not
perfectly
remember
and
therefore
nothing
must
be
forced
in
the
case
for
if
the
contrary
motion
from
a
to
d
and
so
round
be
the
way
to
open
it
you
must
do
the
quite
contrary
in
all
things

When
it
is
open
you
will
find
one
turn
to
lock
it
as
it
does
other
locks

This
much
I
remember
of
the
lock
itself
but
where
the
chest
itself
is
that
the
executors
know
I
for
my
part
know
not

This
I
only
know
that
if
you
can
persuade
my
cousin
somerton
and
his
wife
to
make
use
of
it
and
remove
thither
(
which
I
should
advise
him
to
if
the
plantation
flourishes
and
promises
any
good
he
may
have
this
interest
for
acceptance

As
you
are
content
your
pictures
should
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
merchant
here
that
bought
them
for
you
till
you
have
informed
yourself
concerning
that
sort
of
merchandise
and
to
what
port
either
London
or
Exeter
you
were
best
have
them
so
I
find
he
is
not
in
haste
for
the
slate
of
the
account
between
you
which
therefore
you
need
not
be
at
the
pains
to
send
till
he
demand
it

He
hopes
as
I
perceive
that
this
shall
not
be
the
last
business
he
shall
have
with
you
and
therefore
expects
not
to
have
the
just
balance
returned
but
an
entire
sum
something
near
it
may
serve
the
turn

The
rest
I
perceive
he
is
not
troubled
should
remain
as
a
nest
egg
till
a
farther
occasion
as
much
as
I
know
of
him
he
is
a
very
fair
conditioned
man
and
knows
very
well
your
character

My
service
also
to
my
Valentine
Susan
and
her
man
Thomas
and
to
all
you
mention
in
your
last
letter

Sutton
business
dissatisfies
me
mightily

If
that
estate
will
yield
nothing
by
the
year
I
am
of
opinion
you
should
sell
it
and
make
present
money
of
it
at
least
the
very
proposition
will
quicken
the
man
that
deceived
you
and
your
aunt
so
scurvy

My
most
humble
service
to
your
Lady
and
little
ones

I
am
Sir
your
most
humble
servant
J.L

I
hope
you
will
talk
at
large
and
fully
with
Adrian

He
that
copied
my
last
long
letter
mistook
in
the
names
of
some
books
which
I
much
desire
you
to
correct
and
for
Bacon
to
set
down
Chillingworth
and
for
Tacitus
Tully

I
sent
you
lately
a
part
of
my
reasonings
de
intellectu
humano
which
I
hope
came
safe
for
you
know
we
are
all
concerned
for
our
own
conceptions
how
idle
soever

Sir
Though
I
have
taken
so
much
pains
in
my
business
and
recovered
more
of
haroll
than
I
expected
or
I
believe
I
should
have
done
had
I
been
there
myself
yet
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
you
will
permit
me
to
give
you
thanks

But
whatever
right
you
think
you
have
particularly
to
do
me
all
the
kindness
imaginable
I
crave
leave
to
be
sensible
of
your
favours
and
to
be
sorry
it
lies
not
in
my
power
to
make
acknowledgments
that
may
bear
any
proportion
with
them
I
could
not
forbear
saying
this
much
to
you
and
send
you
half
a
dozen
lines
of
acknowledgment
after
you
had
spent
the
greatest
part
of
twelve
days
in
a
most
troublesome
affair
of
mine

And
therefore
pray
pardon
me
and
believe
that
I
have
no
compliments
for
you
though
I
have
all
the
true
esteem
and
affection
one
friend
can
have
for
another

I
fear
Mr.
Stratton
is
but
a
slow
man
of
London

I
put
something
into
one
of
my
letters
to
you
to
quicken
him

Whether
you
received
it
or
thought
fit
to
make
use
of
it
I
know
not

But
in
good
earnest
it
were
better
that
little
tenement
were
reduced
into
money
than
to
yield
no
other
income
but
trouble
to
me
or
my
friends
though
I
doubt
whether
chapmen
are
there
to
be
had

I
was
sorry
to
hear
by
yours
of
30th
August
of
the
death
of
your
man

I
have
therefore
taken
order
to
have
some
got
for
you
therefore
pray
take
order
with
Mr.
Ewell
about
them
for
to
him
they
will
be
consigned

With
them
you
will
also
receive
some
Muscovy
or
Russian
cabbage
seed
and
some
blood
red
cabbage
seed
which
they
look
on
here
as
the
wholesome
of
all
and
perhaps
not
without
reason
for
let
me
tell
you
this
as
a
thing
worth
your
remembrance
that
it
is
one
of
the
best
remedies
I
know
against
the
scurvy

Besides
boiling
of
it
as
we
do
our
cabbage
ordinarily
they
use
it
here
also
raw
as
their
constant
winter
salad
having
always
a
store
of
them
for
the
winter
which
I
am
told
the
gardeners
preserve
by
laying
them
in
straw
in
deep
holes
dug
into
the
ground
on
purpose

Their
way
of
using
them
for
salads
is
this
they
take
a
cabbage
and
slice
as
much
of
it
off
as
will
serve
for
the
present
meal
just
as
you
would
slice
a
cucumber

Whereby
the
leaves
being
cut
across
fall
into
little
shreds
which
look
handsomely
in
the
dish
and
dressed
with
oil
and
vinegar
is
no
ill
salad

And
if
you
keep
your
counsel
well
I
believe
be
scarce
known
what
it
is
and
the
truth
is
being
very
wholesome
if
I
were
there
I
would
bring
it
into
use
under
some
fine
new
name
for
after
I
had
been
a
little
accustomed
to
it
I
eat
it
with
pleasure

I
wonder
you
had
not
heard
by
the
2nd
of
October
of
several
sorts
of
seeds
sent
you
by
a
neighbour
of
yours
and
the
third
book
De
intellect
humane
sent
by
the
same
hand

Pray
when
you
go
to
market
enquire
after
them
if
you
have
no
news
of
them
sooner

If
you
cannot
learn
that
the
timber
is
good
for
something
I
advise
you
to
plant
no
more
of
them
than
you
have
need
of
for
some
present
shade
or
shelter

For
if
they
are
not
good
timber
they
are
not
beautiful
there
is
nothing
recommends
them
but
their
quick
growth
and
for
me
I
little
value
unless
it
be
some
present
need
things
that
are
soon
ripe
and
soon
rotten

Indeed
I
have
heard
that
their
boards
are
almost
as
good
as
deal
for
floorings
of
rooms
and
dry
uses
but
I
doubt
it

In
a
rich
soil
like
yours
where
all
things
grow
so
well
I
should
choose
to
have
a
walk
up
to
the
front
of
the
house
of
limes
only
for
beauty
two
rows
of
a
side
and
a
space
between
them
as
broad
as
the
front
of
your
house
or
ten
or
fifteen
foot
broader
as
I
formerly
told
you

But
behind
the
house
I
would
have
a
walk
of
the
same
fashion
of
elms
and
on
the
sides
of
other
useful
trees
(
perhaps
oak
should
be
one
which
will
serve
for
beauty
and
use
too
and
pay
for
their
standing

Abeles
I
would
only
place
either
where
others
will
not
grow
or
where
I
have
need
of
a
present
fence
and
then
I
would
place
oaks
amongst
them
or
behind
them
which
is
better
which
might
do
the
business
when
they
are
gone
but
not
knowing
your
design
I
talk
at
random
though
with
a
good
intention

Pray
remember
me
to
your
Spa
friends

Pray
observe
nicely
without
letting
them
perceive
that
you
do
so
how
I
stand
in
each
of
their
books

The
seeding man
tells
me
the
skipper
brings
word
that
he
came
too
late
to
Norway

I
fear
this
an
excuse
for
I
had
bespoke
them
before
you
writ
to
me
but
what
remedy

I
must
be
content
with
a
promise
for
another
year

I
fear
by
your
silence
you
are
not
yet
provided
of
a
man
such
as
we
sought
for
my
young
master

Let
this
(
if
it
be
so
in
the
meantime
satisfy
you
that
none
is
much
better
than
an
unfit
one

And
if
I
knew
what
state
he
at
present
was
in
as
to
learning
I
might
perhaps
think
of
some
way
wherein
he
might
under
your
eye
improve
sufficiently
for
his
years
without
almost
any
trouble
to
you
and
so
the
principles
of
virtue
sense
and
breeding
which
are
the
main
business
be
preserved
and
nursed
up
in
the
way
you
have
begun
and
not
all
these
as
is
used
be
sacrificed
to
a
little
Latin
under
the
management
of
an
ill
or
imprudent
tutor
unskilled
as
it
often
happens
in
those
essential
points

Though
it
has
hitherto
escaped
my
pen
yet
it
has
been
often
in
my
head
to
enquire
what
course
you
took
about
your
water
and
whether
you
are
supplied
from
the
spring
we
examined
when
I
was
there

I
have
had
many
projects
upon
that
affair
in
my
head
though
I
never
troubled
you
with
any
of
them
hoping
that
your
house
is
well
supplied
with
good
water
without
them

But
finding
that
other
people's
letters
were
refused
to
be
meddled
with
I
thought
it
good
manners
not
to
give
the
trouble
of
any
of
mine
so
that
the
two
Ladies
were
excused
one
from
carrying
and
the
other
from
reading
a
long
letter
from
me

But
pray
tell
her
she
has
no
great
loss
in
it

For
it
being
past
doubt
that
I
am
her
humble
servant
with
the
utmost
affection
and
respect
anybody
can
be
I
had
nothing
to
add
to
it
but
compliments
for
my
being
at
that
distance
which
permits
me
not
those
opportunities
of
performing
those
parts
of
duty
and
gratitude
belong
to
me
and
enjoying
sometimes
at
Chipley
the
company
I
most
desire
in
the
world

I
am
Sir
your
most
obliged
and
most
humble
servant
J.L

Pray
remember
me
to
young
master
and
my
little
pretty
Mistress

J.
I
take
it
something
amiss
that
you
have
said
nothing
particularly
of
her
to
me
this
long
time
but
I
am
glad
to
hear
from
another
hand
that
all
your
little
ones
thrive
bravely
for
so
I
am
told
in
a
letter
I
lately
received

The
news
you
may
believe
was
very
welcome
both
because
I
have
so
much
reason
to
love
father
and
mother
and
all
the
family
and
also
I
am
glad
to
find
that
my
plain
rustic
way
of
feeding
and
nursing
children
has
not
such
hardships
in
it
as
to
hurt
even
the
tender
sex

For
I
flatter
myself
that
Madam
in
breeding
her
daughters
has
inclined
a
little
to
my
method

Though
bating
that
and
the
negligence
of
the
style
you
will
find
very
little
in
the
argument
itself
that
I
think
for
the
matter
of
it
needs
altering

Of
what
use
it
may
be
to
any
other
I
cannot
tell
but
if
I
flatter
not
myself
I
has
been
of
great
help
to
our
first
enquiry
and
the
search
of
knowledge
ever
since
has
been
in
my
thoughts
which
is
now
five
or
six
years

For
so
long
ago
is
it
since
some
friends
upon
an
accidental
discourse
started
me
upon
this
enquiry
which
I
am
not
sorry
for

And
if
it
has
cost
me
some
pains
in
thinking
it
has
rewarded
me
by
the
light
I
imagine
I
have
received
from
it
as
well
as
by
the
pleasure
of
discovering
certain
truths
which
to
me
at
least
were
new

for
being
resolved
to
examine
humane
understanding
and
the
ways
of
our
knowledge
not
by
others'
opinions
but
by
what
I
could
from
my
own
observations
collect
myself
I
have
purposely
avoided
the
reading
of
all
books
that
treated
any
way
of
the
subject
that
so
I
might
have
nothing
to
bias
me
any
way
but
might
leave
my
thought
free
to
entertain
only
what
the
matter
itself
suggested
to
my
meditations

So
that
if
they
at
any
time
jump
with
others
it was
not
that
I
followed
them
and
if
they
differ
it was
not
out
of
contradiction
or
a
mind
to
be
singular

My
aim
has
been
only
truth
so
far
as
my
short-sightedness
could
reach
it
and
where
I
have
misstated
it
in
part
or
in
the
whole
I
shall
be
glad
to
be
set
right

Read
it
therefore
as
a
friend's
act
judge
of
it
as
a
stranger's
and
let
me
have
your
opinion
with
the
greatest
freedom
than
which
there
can
be
nothing
more
obliging
to
Your
most
humble
servant
J.L

DEAR
SIR
Since
my
last
I
have
gotten
the
abridgement
which
came
to
me
in
quires
bound
and
gilded
as
the
other
was
and
according
to
your
order
have
placed
it
in
Sir
Walter’s
hands
to
be
conveyed
to
Mrs.
Duke

And
the
other
which
remains
in
marble
paper
I
shall
also
send
by
him
to
Mr.
Freke
about
a
fortnight
hence
when
he
designs
to
go
out
of
town
if
I
have
no
other
opportunity
by
a
safe
hand
in
the
meantime
to
convey
it
to
him

I
have
also
gotten
you
a
good
beaver
hat
made
by
the
diameter
of
the
inside
of
the
crown
of
the
band
exactly
according
to
the
dimension
marked
by
the
two
black
pins
in
your
letter
of
the
ninth
instant

A
peruke
I
have
also
bought
for
you
pursuant
to
your
directions
in
the
same
letter
as
near
as
possible
as
I
could

And
these
together
with
six
flannel-shirts
(
bought
and
made
up
by
your
very
good
friend
Mrs.
R.S

and
a
cloak
which
in
the
buying
and
making
up
I
gave
her
my
best
assistance
I
have
sent
hence
by
your
old
friend
Adrian
who
stayed
but
one
day
in
town
and
is
this
day
set
out
from
hence
towards
you
and
it
is
possible
may
be
with
you
as
soon
(
or
before
this
can
come
to
your
hands

He
promised
me
to
take
particular
care
of
them
all
and
to
see
them
safely
delivered
to
you
which
I
hope
he
will
do
they
being
all
in
my
opinion
extremely
good
of
the
kind
and
I
believe
will
give
content
in
the
wearing

By
him
you
will
also
receive
a
letter
that
I
had
from
Mr.
Stringer
in
answer
to
what
by
your
order
I
writ
to
him
touching
your
picture
by
which
you
will
find
that
he
is
resolved
not
to
part
with
it

But
since
there
are
so
many
accidents
which
may
contradict
my
intentions
in
this
particular
I
dare
promise
nothing
but
trust
on
providence
to
send
us
a
happy
meeting
which
I
earnestly
desire
and
long
for

In
the
meantime
give
me
leave
to
assure
you
that
I
will
use
all
imaginable
care
and
caution
to
find
out
the
truth
of
what
was
done
in
that
affair
touching
w
p
and
my
cousin
that
in
your
last
you
mentioned
to
me

And
I
will
also
take
care
to
get
’sop's
Fables
in
Latin
English
and
French
with
cuts
as
you
have
ordered
and
will
wait
your
further
directions
for
making
the
best
use
of
them

Just
now
I
received
the
enclosed
from
my
son
with
his
earnest
desires
that
in
my
next
it
might
be
conveyed
to
you

It
was
in
the
shape
of
a
letter
directed
to
you
but
the
backpart
of
it
for
the
convenience
of
postage
I
took
off
and
hope
you
will
pardon
both
him
and
me
for
troubling
you
with
it
since
you
will
there
see
what
good
effects
the
following
of
your
methods
in
teaching
the
child
to
write
as
well
as
all
other
things
has
already
produced

He
begins
to
be
sensible
of
the
great
kindness
you
have
done
him
and
I
hope
as
he
increases
in
knowledge
he
will
be
no
less
grateful
than
him
who
by
all
manner
of
ties
you
have
obliged
to
be
never
other
than
Your
most
affectionate
faithful
servant
E
Madam
gives
her
hearty
service
to
you
is
very
well
but
not
yet
laid
and
joins
her
desires
with
mine
that
you
will
send
prints
of
those
copies
of
which
you
have
already
given
us
a
sight
the
character
being
much
better
(
as
I
think
than
any
I
can
get
here
etc.

I
have
written
again
to
Mr.
Elwill
who
has
repeated
his
promises
under
hand
to
me
that
he
will
take
particular
care
to
send
the
bags
again
to
Mr.
Furley
wherein
the
provision
for
the
sheep
was
sent
over
etc.

Addr

DEAR
SIR
Saturday
night
last
I
returned
hither
from
the
West
and
found
my
wife
and
children
well
here

I
was
with
your
cousin
Stratton
at
Sutton
Court
and
at
his
own
house
about
a
fortnight
since
but
could
not
be
so
serviceable
to
you
there
as
I
designed
by
reason
he
had
not
nor
could
not
possibly
(
as
he
said
make
out
your
account
for
me
but
promised
to
return
fifty
pounds
of
your
money
hither
to
me
with
the
first
opportunity
and
make
his
accounts
perfect
against
my
coming
again
into
that
country

There
are
generally
great
complaints
of
the
difficulties
to
raise
money
amongst
tenants
but
I
meet
with
none
greater
than
those
I
have
heard
from
Mr.
Stratton
the
tenants
thereabouts
being
much
worse
than
formerly
and
(
as
he
says
are
grown
so
poor
and
scarce
that
unless
they
are
permitted
to
have
their
rents
left
in
their
hands
for
a
considerable
time
and
other
advantages
besides
there
is
not
a
tenant
to
be
had
for
anything
in
these
parts

By
all
which
I
presume
there
are
some
arrears
greater
than
he
was
willing
to
tell
me
the
particulars
of
at
that
time
especially
having
a
prospect
that
the
greatest
part
of
them
will
be
speedily
gotten
in

Mr.
Stratton
has
followed
the
method
I
directed
and
without
any
difficulty
and
trouble
has
got
into
his
hands
your
lease
to
Robert
Haroll
of
the
homeclose
at
Beluton
etc
which
will
be
a
further
security
for
what
remains
due
from
him
to
prevent
him
in
his
design
of
making
such
unreasonable
advantages
upon
you
as
he
intended
by
it

My
time
at
present
will
not
permit
me
to
give
you
a
more
particular
account
of
your
affairs
in
Somerset
but
if
I
can
be
so
happy
as
to
see
you
this
summer
as
I
intended
you
will
then
be
more
fully
informed
but
ever
since
I
fixed
my
thoughts
of
that
enjoyment
everything
has
seemed
to
conspire
against
me
in
it

First
many
cross
accidents
in
my
own
affairs
have
happened
besides
the
death
of
my
Lady
King
which
brought
me
into
a
trust
for
her
children

And
immediately
upon
that
the
sickness
and
death
of
my
cousin
Clarke's
lady
here
he
being
at
that
time
extremely
ill
and
since
dead
in
the
country
leaving
the
care
of
his
estate
and
four
young
children
upon
me
has
so
much
increased
my
affairs
and
troubles
that
at
present
I
can
hardly
see
a
way
through
them

is
just
now
come
in
with
your
letter
that
came
enclosed
the
last
week
to
her
for
me
and
gives
you
her
real
love
and
service
but
at
present
the
time
will
not
permit
me
to
answer
any
part
of
it

But
you
may
be
certain
I
will
carefully
perform
what
is
therein
desired
and
answer
it
with
the
first
opportunity
and
for
ever
remain
your
most
affectionate
friend

faithful

For
Mr.
Locke

London
15th
June
1688

Dear
Sir
Soon
after
the
writing
of
the
5th
instant
to
you
I
was
taken
ill
of
a
disease
that
of
late
has
been
almost
universal
in
the
town
which
fell
into
my
eyes
and
disabled
me
for
all
manner
of
business
for
a
considerable
time

But
I
can
now
inform
you
that
I
have
spoken
with
Mr.
Oakley
who
tells
me
that
he
pursued
Adrian's
orders
with
a
blind
obedience
in
that
affair
relating
to
R.B

and
by
letter
has
given
you
a
particular
account
thereof

As
to
your
affair
with
Mr.
Stringer
touching
your
picture
I
have
seriously
considered
all
parts
of
it
and
without
partiality
do
assure
you
that
I
cannot
find
anything
blameable
in
any
of
your
proceedings
therein
and
therefore
as
opportunity
serves
I
will
use
my
utmost
skill
and
interest
to
make
Mr.
Stringer
sensible
thereof
and
put
an
end
to
the
contest
if
it
be
to
be
done

And
what
further
I
may
be
sensible
to
you
in
shall
at
all
times
be
faithfully
and
willingly
performed
by
Your
most
affectionate
humble
servant
E
Your
old
friend
Nathaniel
Hodges
will
be
in
town
the
latter
end
of
this
week
and
he
shall
have
the
only
remaining
abrégé
delivered
to
him
as
you
desire
etc.

Mr.
Cheswell
has
paid
all
home
to
Christmas
last
etc.

Madam
and
the
young
fry
are
well
and
give
you
their
best
service
etc.

Addr

For
Mr.
John
Locke
these

Dear
Sir
Your
kind
letter
of
the
17th
has
been
now
a
full
week
in
my
hands
for
which
you
had
immediately
received
my
thanks
had
I
been
able
to
write

But
soon
after
my
last
of
the
16th
from
Salisbury
to
you
I
was
taken
ill
of
an
ague
with
an
ill
fever
that
attended
it
which
so
much
weakened
me
that
it
was
not
without
great
difficulty
I
got
hither
but
by
use
of
the
Cortex
Peruv

The
lime
tree
seeds
and
the
turnip
seeds
you
mention
will
be
no
less
acceptable
when
they
come
but
I
hear
nothing
as
yet
of
their
arrival

I
am
entirely
satisfied
in
every
article
of
yours
and
Mr.
F.'s
accounts
and
do
not
doubt
but
Mr.
Percival
will
make
punctual
payment
of
the
bill
that
is
drawn
on
him
for
110
17
shillings
11
pence
mentioned
in
your
letter

But
I
have
neither
strength
nor
time
to
thank
my
good
friend
Benjamin
Furly
as
I
ought
either
for
his
great
kindness
to
me
whilst
I
was
in
Holland
or
the
extraordinary
care
and
trouble
he
has
taken
for
me
since

And
therefore
I
beg
you
to
make
him
sensible
of
my
hearty
acknowledgements
and
earnest
hopes
that
I
may
some
time
or
other
be
happy
in
an
opportunity
to
serve
him

And
I
heartily
thank
you
for
opening
the
complimentary
letter
you
mention
that
was
directed
to
me

And
I
wish
you
had
done
the
like
by
the
other
also
for
I
cannot
guess
at
the
hand
by
that
part
of
the
superscription
you
sent
me

Therefore
pray
open
that
also
and
in
your
next
let
me
know
the
contents
of
it
if
material
and
by
whom
it
was
written

And
with
mine
and
madam's
true
love
and
service
to
you
and
all
the
good
family
with
you
I
subscribe
though
perfectly
tired
yet
your
most
affectionate
friend
and
obliged
servant

DEAR
NEPHEW
-
I
give
you
many
thanks
for
your
kind
letter
and
the
sense
you
have
of
my
affliction
which
is
truly
very
great

But
since
it
is
laid
upon
me
by
the
hands
of
an
Almighty
and
gracious
God
that
always
proportions
His
punishments
to
the
support
He
gives
with
them
I
may
hope
to
bear
it
as
a
Christian
ought
to
do
and
more
especially
one
that
is
conscious
to
herself
of
having
in
many
ways
deserved
it

The
strong
revolutions
we
have
seen
might
well
have
taught
me
what
this
world
is
yet
it
seems
it
was
necessary
that
I
should
have
a
nearer
example
of
the
uncertainty
of
all
human
blessings
that
so
having
no
tie
to
the
world
I
may
the
better
prepare
myself
to
leave
it
and
that
this
correction
may
suffice
to
teach
me
my
duty
is
the
prayer
of-Your
most
affectionate
aunt
and
humble
servant

We
are
got
hither
at
last
and
Papa
I
thank
God
very
well
and
so
insufferably
pert
with
winning
12
guineas
at
Crimp
last
night

When
she
is
there
pray
enquire
a
great
deal
of
our
East
India
ships
with
which
she
is
concerned
as
well
as
I
and
nobody
can
inform
you
better
of
what
I
most
desire
to
know
is
whether
I
may
take
part
of
my
share
in
what
I
like
or
must
be
obliged
to
have
it
all
in
money
if
it is
divided
which
whether
it
be
much
or
little
to
me
would
make
a
great
difference

And
now
I
must
tell
you
what
misfortunes
have
here
befalled
some
of
your
friends
and
mine

My
Lord
Portland
and
Monsieur
Overkerke
I
hear
have
had
a
quarrell
at
Loo
and
the
last
they
say
treated
him
like
a
dog
which
I
am
apt
enough
to
believe
for
people
are
too
apt
to
insult
when
one
is
falling
and
when
nobody
will
help
to
right
one

I
believe
one
has
seldom
the
heart
to
do
anything
towards
it
themselves
this
they
say
has
extremely
exalted
another
person
and
altogether
it is
thought
more
than
my
Lord
Portland
can
bear
altogether
any
longer
that
he
may
not
want
a
companion
in
his
afternoons
I
hear
that
Mrs.
Howard
came
the other
day
from
where
Mrs.
Billingsly
had
order
to
take
the
care
the
children
from
her
and
when
she
came
to
my
Lord
of
Essex'
lodgings
at
London
she
found
a
padlock

Upon
that
she
could
not
get
in
which
Mr.
Billingsly
said
he
had
my
Lord
Essex's
order
for

You
know
whether
I
am
rightly
informed
in
all
this
and
pray
send
a
yard
of
muslin
for
pinners
and
ten
yards
of
crowsfoot
to
edge
it
with
to
Mrs.
Hanbury
before
you
leave
town
the
Duke
and
Duchess
of
Richmond
dine
here
today
and
so
my
news
and
my
letter
are
at
an
end
together

Adieu
I
desire
you
will
send
word
to
East
Sheene
what
is
become
of
it
there
is
now
no
doubt
of
our
being
home
to
receive
our
letters
on
Friday

You
never
told
me
what
became
of
Friday
Night

If
my
Father
cannot
prevail
with
you
to
remove
from
that
dismal
place
I
will
certainly
see
you
there
the
beginning
of
next
week
in
the
mean
time
all
you
desired
shall
be
speedily
done

And
I
cannot
end
without
making
it
my
request
that
you
should
for
my
sake
take
some
care
of
yourself
and
let
not
your
trouble
overcome
you
which
I
am
afraid
it
will
do
if
you
don't
strive
against
it

I
beg
to
have
my
humble
duty
presented
to
my
Father
whose
affliction
I
am
most
heartily
concerned
for

I
would
myself
have
written
to
him
but
that
two
such
letters
are
not
to
be
written
I
mightily
desire
that
I
may
hear
how
you
and
your
Father
do
and
dear
(
Ant
remember
yourself
in
thinking
how
many
kind
friends
you
have
left
which
I
am
sure
deserve
your
care
and
some
return
for
their
concern
for
you

I
wish
I
had
gone
down
now
with
my
Father
but
next
week
if
it
please
God
somewhere
I
will
see
you
till
when
I
shall
not
be
easy

Adieu

The
only
reason
that
kept
me
from
writing
to
you
Dear
Madam
was
the
fear
I
had
of
troubling
you
but
I
cannot
forbear
any
longer
from
telling
you
how
sure
a
sense
I
have
of
your
misfortune
I
shall
always
be
most
heartily
sorry
for
any
thing
that
afflicts
you
but
in
this
I
think
myself
particularly
concerned
for
both
my
Lord
and
I
have
lost
a
friend
we
had
a
very
real
esteem
and
kindness
for
and
shall
ever
have
so
for
his
memory
I
will
say
no
more
on
so
sad
a
subject
but
end
this
with
begging
you
to
believe
that
no
body
living
is
more
sincerely
your
faithfull
humble
servant
E.

DEAR
MADAM
I
wish
the
many
sharers
you
have
in
your
great
trouble
could
hope
to
cast
off
the
heavy
load
that
must
of
necessity
lie
upon
you
for
the
loss
of
the
best
of
friends
the
Kingdom
has
a
loss
in
such
a
person
and
everyone
that
was
happy
in
knowing
of
him

I
am
sure
my
poor
self
has
lost
a
very
kind
good
friend
the
best
is
I
am
so
near
going
the
same
way
soon
which
must
help
to
make
all
things
more
indifferent
to
me
whilst
I
am
upon
earth

I
have
made
all
the
inquiries
I
could
after
you
and
do
hear
you
have
some
of
your
relations
gone
to
you
I
would
most
willingly
have
come
myself
but
I
feared
rather
the
giving
you
trouble
your
being
able
to
do
you
any
service
and
then
since
Providence
has
this
ordered
it
I
might
be
so
happy
as
that
your
Ladyship
and
I
could
live
and
die
together
it
should
be
which
way
you
pleased
either
town
or
cuntry
is
alike
to
me
and
the
small
fortune
I
have
you
should
come
and
to
keep
as
which
way
you
like
best
but
you
are
a
better
orderer
than
I
therefore
I
should
desire
to
commit
it
to
your
hands
I
very
much
fear
you
will
not
grant
my
request
yet
I
could
not
but
be
so
kind
to
myself
as
to
make
the
earliest
offer
to
you

My
Lord
Carlisle
still
persuing
his
resolutions
of
going
into
the
North
whatever

I
suppose
to
see
you
on
Palm
Sunday

Also
as
touching
the
person
of
Dudecote
he
was
with
me
and
as
when
I
spoke
with
him
last
at
Hampden
he
said
he
would
pay
to
me
the
money
the
which
I
wrote
to
him
for
so
that
I
would
suffer
him
to
have
a
priest
to
serve
his
church
and
he
to
dwell
with
me
and
where
I
would
suffer
him
but
I
granted
him
not
his
asking
but
yet
nevertherless
to
put
all
things
in
rest
and
for
cause
he
has
christened
a
child
of
mine
and
I
hold
it
best
to
suffer
him
a
while
to
be
absent
and
I
pray
you
he
is
now
at
London
enquire
how
he
governs
him
there
and
send
me

The

her

you
evermore

And
on
this
Sunday
in
slandering
of
me
he
passed
to
Saint
Ebbis
and
gert
his
brother

the
parish
priest
pace

him

would

no
mass
be
said
nor
service
done
to
the
parish
within
the
church
of
Coldingham

I
was
not
content
thereof
and
came
to
Coldingham
the
same
Sunday
late
at
evening
and
spoke
somewhat
with
dean
John
Pencher

a
pair

fulfilled
the

there
should
never

us

I

Wherefore
most

we
beseech
your

that
you
will
open
your
eyes
of
pity
and
compassion
upon
your

here
which
as
now
live
in
great
dread
and
without
that
help
be
had
the
rather
are
like
to
perish
and
that
you
will
also
call
unto
your
consideration
how
this
your
Duchy
of
Guienne
is
one of
the oldest
lordships
longing
to
your
crown
of
England
and
thereupon
of
your
most
merciful
and
pitious
grace
command
and
do
such
diligence
be
had
that
your
succours
be
sent
in
hasty
time
after
the
form
of
your
said
letters
so
that
by
negligence
or
delays
it
come
not
too
late
and
inconvenience
irrecuperable
be
grown
in
the
meantime
which
God
defend
in
such
wise
also
that
we
are
found
no
gabbers
in
executing
your
commandment

your

Please
it
your
highness
to
wit
the
tidings
of
this
country
that
on
Friday
the
third
day
of
August
the
city
of
Aix
which
is
held
the
strongest
of
all
Guienne
was
won
and
your
adversary
was
in
hit
and
his
son
called
the
Dauphin
with
the
Constable
and
Marshal
of
France
forthwith
have
laid
siege
unto
your
city
of
Baion
which
as
they
say
makes
them
sure
to
have
it
within
8
days
and
from
thence
straight
to
come
to
Bordeaux
where
as
God
knows
is
division
and
never
was
so
little
help
nor
store
of
English
people
the
lack
of
whom
is
cause
of
loss
of
all
this
country
as
we
doubt
not
unless
that
succour
be
had
without
any
delay
all
is
gone

Nevertheless
the
castle
holds
as
yet
and
within
it
for
lack
of
other
help
there
been
of
our
fellowship
all
such
as
we
might
spare
God
send
them
comfort
and
more
help
by
time

Over
this
at
the
request
of
your
counsel
here
and
for
our
true
acquittal
we
advise
as
we
dare
your
Highness
for
the
well
of
you
and
of
this
your
country
here
not
lightly
to
pass
upon
such
grants
of
your
demesnes
or
of
other
lands
rents
or
revenues
here
as
peradventure
shall
be
asked
of
your
said
Highness
but
that
it
please
your
Majesty
to abide
the
advise
of
your
said
counsel
which
purpose
by
commune
and
moor
deliberation
to ascertain
your
said
Majesty
of
such
inconveniences
as
by
such
grants
have
grown
herebefore
and
in
what
wise
they
may
for
your
well
be
eschewed
hereafter

Wherefore
I
beseech
you
at
the
reverence
of
Saint
Cuthbert
who
is
your
patron
and
whose
rights
you
are
in
manner
bound
to
sustain
and
defend
that
you
will
labour
to
our

lorde
the

the
Pope
for
the
good
speed
and
furthering
of
our
said
matters
after
the
form
conceived
by
my
most
worshipful
lord
cardinal
of
York
by
whom
I
and
my
brethren
are
ruled
and
governanced
in
this
cause
which
form
the
bearer
of
this

if
it
please
you
shall
deliver
to

Wherefore
after
this
grievous
complaint
as
was
before
said
made
unto
me
I
your
priest
and
beadsman
before
that
I
would
in
any
wise
proceed
to
any
correction
as
I
am
bidden
under
pine
of
damnation
to
do
have
been
delibered
in
myself
to
let
your
noble
lordship
have
witting
thereof
to
the
intent
that
it
may
not
by
reason
be
deemed

supposed
that
any
will
should
pass
virtue
or
headiness
offend
the
virtue
of
humility
or
patience
and
also
to
the intent
that
I
may
have
herein
some
manner
understanding
and
feeling
of
your
blessed
disposition
whereof
I
lowly
beseech
you
and
as
far
as
I
may
in
God's
behalf
require
you
in
some
ways
to
be
consorted
and
ascertained
by
the
bearer
of
this
my
simple
sorrow

How
the
said
Richard
Druell
and
William
Speere
speeded
when
they
came
to
London
it
appears
in
a
schedule
by
the
said
Richard
Druell
and
William
Speer
thereof
made
remaining
with
the
said
Rychard
Druell

We
met
and
spoke
with
him
in
the
inner
chamber
he
at
that
time
being
right
busy
going
in
to
his
closet

The
justice
said
he
would
be
ready
at
his
calling

And
so
departed
etc.

And
there
is
a
man
in
Truntch
*called
Palmer
too
that
had
of
your
father
certain
land
in
Truntch
over
7
years
or
8
years
ago
for
corn
and
truly
has
paid
all
the
years
and
now
he
has
suffered
the
corn
to
be
withset
for
8
s
of
rent
to
Gymmyngham
which
your
father
paid
never

And
moreover
in
supplement
of
the
foresaid
sum
it
is
my
will
and
my
brother
afore
rehearsed
that
you
take
the
hands
of
the
arrearage
of
his
time
that
is
unraised
of
Dan
Richard
Wrake
which
arrearage
you
have
stopped
as
it
is
said
against
right
and
my
brother
aforesaid
has
exhibited
and
shown
to
me
a
bill
of
notable
costs
charges
and
expense
made
by
him
in
the
time
he
stood
Prior
there
which
is
no
fiend
thing
as
he
refers
him
to
his
brothers
that
was
with
him
and
has
knowledge
thereof
as
he
will
prove
in
time
and
place
required
in
that
party

great
vessels
of
the
enemies

Written
at
Paston
on
Monday
after
Hallowmess
Day

And
I
let
him
*know
he
that
put
it
down
shall
pay
therefore

Right
worshipful
and
my
full
trusty
and
specially
beloved
sir
I
recommend
me
to
you
in

true

beseeching

as
my
singular
trust
is

In
all
these
matters
I
pray
you
prove
you
a

to
Saint
Cuthbert
and
a

And
say
Elizabeth
Paston
that
she
must
use
herself
to
work
readily
as
other
gentlewomen
do
and
somewhat
to
help
herself
therewith

And
in
all
other
things
as
to
my
Lady
Pool
with
whom
I
sojourned
that
you
will
be
my
tender
and
good
mother
that
she
may
be
paid
for
all
the
costs
done
to
me
before
my
marriage
and
to
Cristofre
Hanson
as
you
wrote
unto
my
brother
John
that
it
should
have
been
so

Other
tidings
I
can
none
send
but
I
beseech
the
holy
ghost
be
your

The

On
Thursday
all

there
were
kept

persons

and
nightly

20
persons

Yours

They
said
their
coming
was
but
to
take
out
such
riotous
people
as
was
here
within
this
place
and
such
as
were
the
King's
felonies
and
indited
and
outlawed
men
nevertheless
they
would
show
no
warrants
whereby
to
take
none
such
though
there
had
been
such
here

Please
it
you
to
know
that
on
Friday
after
my
departing
from
you
I
was
at
Sudbury
and
spoke
with
the
sheriff
and
Richard
Calle
*gave
him
the
two
writs

Written
the
Friday
next
before
Michaelmas
Day

I
spoke
with
Sir
John
Hevenyngham
and
informed
him
with
the
trough
of
the
matter
and
of
all
our
demeaning
at
Drayton
and
he
said
he
would
that
all
thing
were
well
and
that
he
would
inform
my
Lord
as
I
said
to
him
but
Harleston
had
all
the
words
and
the
rule
with
the
Duke
here
and
after
his
advice
and
Doctor
Aleyne's
he
was
advised
here
at
this
time

Right
worshipful
husband
I
recommend
me
to
you
I
was
at
Haylesdon
upon
Thursday
last
past
and
saw
the
place
there
and
in
good
faith
there
will
no
creature
think
how
foul
and
horribly
it
is
arrayed
but
if
they
saw
it

The
mayor
of
Norwich
did
arrest
the
bailiff
of
Normandies
Lovegold
Gregory
Cordonere
and
Bartholomew
Fuller
without
any
authority
save
only
he
says
that
he
has
a
commandment
of
the
Duke
to
do
so
and
he
will
not
let
them
out
of
prison
till
he
had
surete
for
each
of
them
in
4
pounds
for
to
awnswer
to
such
matters
as
the
Duke
and
his
council
will
put
against
them
at
any
time
that
they
be
called
and
so
will
he
do
to
others
as
many
as
he
may
get
that
owe
you
any
good
will

After
that
I
tarried
at
Dover
more
than
10
days
abiding
passage
the
which
was
right
perilous
for
the
thickness
of
mists
but
God
be
loved
I
and
my
fellowship
about
midnight
got
Calais
in
good
hele
and
sane
guard

I
beseech
you
make
him
good
cheer
and
send
me
word
by
him
how
I
shall
be
disposed
and
come
home
to

time

from
mine
albeit
my

I
would
have
had
wherewith
the

displeased
with
us
both

we

well
it

Now

Trusty

whereas
we

by

at
this
time
that
you
have
taken
upon
you
now
of
late
to
make
masteries
within
our
forest
and
chase
of
Barnewood
and
Exsille
and
that
in
contempt
of
us
uncourteously
to
hunt
and
slay
our
deer
within
the
same
to
our
great
marvel
and
displeasure
we
will
you
wit
that
we
intend
to
sue
such
remedy
therein
as
shall
accord
with
my
lord’s
laws

Sir
I
understand
the
good
that
comes
now
from
London
and
Ippswich
must
pay
part
of
the
same
payment

And
as
for
master
Lowys
More
Lomberd
is
paid
and
I
have
the
bill

Item
sir
your
wool
is
awarded
by
the
sarplier
that
I
cast
out
last
etc.

Wherefore
the
general
stands
in
non
affect
and
so
many
as
are
here
having
no
singular
safeconduct
are
in
jeopardy

per
your
servant
William
Cely

No
more
unto
your
masterships
at
this
time
but
almighty
Jesus
preserve
you

And
the
rest
of
your
300
pounds
remains
still
by
me
for
I
can
make
you
over
no
more
at
this
season
for
here
is
no
more
that
will
take
any
money
as
yet

But
sir
I
cannot
have
your
wool
yet
awarded
for
I
have
do
cast
out
a
sarplier
the
which
is
pointed
by
the
lieutenant
to
be
cast
out
to
ward
the
sort
by
as
the
ordinance
is
now
made
that
the
lieutenant
shall
point
the
warding
sarpliers
of
every
man's
wool
the
which
sarplier
that
I
have
cast
out
is
No.
24
and
therein
is
found
by
William
Smith
packer
a
60
middle
fleeces
and
it
is
a
very
gruff
wool
and
so
I
have
caused
William
Smith
privily
to
cast
out
another
sarplier

To
the
worshipful
Sir
Robert
Plompton
knight
be
this
delivered
in
haste

And
he
will
not
let
him
have
them
without
a
replevin
and
I
trow
he
will
die
in
the
field
for
I
sent
William
Skirgell
and
William
Croft
and
they
cannot
get
him
without
a
*caution

But
my
son
keeps
them
forth
as
yet
and
therefore
I
trust
my
Lord
Archbishop
will
complain
of
my
son
and
you
and
said
that
he
will
indict
them
that
was
at
casting
out
of
them

And
I
pray
you
to
send
some
writing
to
Thomas
Meryng
for
the
repayment
of
the
money
and
your
discharge

To
master
Thomas
Everingam
be
this
delivered
in
haste

You
shall
hear
here
these
matters
that
we
intend
to
common
of
but
first
you
shall
be
both
sworn
upon
a
book
that
you
shall
never
utter
nothing
that
is
now
here
spoken
without
it
be
to
the
King's
grace
if
need
shall
require
or
else
to
non
living
creature

Item
my
master
your
deputy
said
"
My
Lord
Chamberlain
was
very
slack
in
one
journey
wherewith
I
know well
that
the
King's
grace
was
discontent
for
and
he
had
done
his
part
well
the
Cornish
men
had
never
made
the
King
fell
at
Blake
heath
but
had
all
been
destroyed
long
before
their
coming
thither
that
I
know well
the
King's
grace
had
liefer
had
be
done
than
20
thousand
for
his
honour

Then
said
Sir
Hughe
Conway
to
him
again
"
I
pray
you
suffer
me
to
tell
forth
my
tale
for
I
am
not
yet
atthe
end

At
last
he
asked
what
he
was
that
told
me
thus
tale
of
his
departing

Item
after
this
the
treasurer
said
"
Master
deputy
and
master
porter
what
danger
are
we
in
now
remembering
all
things
well
for
we
have
no
such
holds
to
resort
unto
as
these
other
men
have
considering
also
our
many
enemies
that
we
have
in
this
town
and
else
where
that
will be
glad
to
destroy
and
murder
us
all
if
other
should
come
to
the
King’s
grace
than
weal

Let
not
us
think
the
contrary
but
and
the
King’s
were
once
departed
she
being
in
the
castle
here
and
Edmond
De
la
Pole
her
cousin
at
his
liberty
but
that
she
would
help
him
in
his
causes
with
all
her
power
and
to
let
him
come
into
this
town
by
the
postern
of
the
castle
to
the
destruction
of
us
all

Item
then
said
my
master
your
deputy
"
If
such
thing
shall
happen
as
I
pray
God
that
I
never
live
to
see
the
King’s
grace
to
depart
before
me
but
and
it
please
God
that
he
shall
so
do
to
be
for
the
surety
and
use
of
my
Lord
prince
and
for
all
my
master's
children
to
have
this
town
all
times
at
their
own
will
and
rule
and
rather
than
it
should
be
otherwise
I
had
liefer
suffer
death

And
also
Sir
I
will
not
let
Thomas
Croft
wife
plow
nor
occupy
her
fermeald
but
said
she
shall
not
occupy
without
your
life

Sir
I
beseech
you
to
remember
your
great
cost
and
charges
and
mine
and
labour
the
matter
that
it
might
have
an
end
for
they
have
taken
on
capias
and
delivered
for
certain
of
your
tenants

No
more
at
this
time
but
the
Trinity
keep
you

From
Plompton
in
haste
the
13th
day
of
April

By
your
wife
(
26
April
1504

God
send
me
comfort
to
his
pleasure
and
that
I
and
mine
that
be
left
here
with
me
be
well
entreated
such
ways
as
they
have
taken

I
will
beseech
you
and
him
to
take
no
displeasure
with
me
for
my
departing
for
it
will be
no
otherwise
my
heart
is
so
sad

All
which
things
according
to
your
desire
and
pleasure
I
have
with
all
my
heart
and
good
will
given
and
granted
unto
you

Wherefore
eftsoons
in
my
most
humble
wise
I
thank
you
and
I
purpose
hereafter
at
better
leisure
to
know
your
mind
and
pleasure
further
therein

Sir
there
is
land
in
Rybston
field
that
Christopher
Chambers
would
buy
if
you
will
sell
it
but
I
am
not
assured
what
he
will
give
for
it

Wherefore
I
humbly
beseech
you
to
be
so
good
and
kind
father
unto
me
as
to
let
me
know
your
pleasure
how
that
you
will
have
me
ordered
as
shortly
as
it
shall
like
you

But
my
dear
heart
I
will
no
more
encumber
your
Grace
with
further
writing
in
this
matter
for
I
am
Sir
your
chaplin
and
servant
Doctor
Whytston
has
shown
your
Highness
the
circumstance
of
the
same

Edith
Neville

And
I
pray
you
madam
let
not
my
Mrs
your
daughter
wit
of
it
for
then
she
will
never
trust
my
husband
nor
me

Our
husband
knows
it
is
withheld
for
his
sake
and
will
recompense
us
safer
as
the
Doctor
show
him

I
was
very
glad
to
hear
the
meeting
of
them
both
which
has
been
to
my
seeming
the
greatest
honour
to
the
King
that
ever
came
to
Prince

In
this
your
grace
shall
see
how
I
can
keep
my
promise
sending
you
for
your
banners
a
King’s
coat

MASTER
Almoner
when
the
last
messenger
went
I
wrote
not
to
you
because
I

not
the
surety
of
every
thing
that
was
done

the

against
the

My
most
kind
and
loving
brother
I
heartily
recommend
me
unto
you

And
now
am
I
left
post
alone
in
effect
for
on
the
morn
next
after
e
marriage
my
chamberlain
with
all
other
men
servants
were
discharged
and
in
like
wise
my
mother
Guldford
with
other
my
women
and
maidens
except
such
as
never
had
experience
nor
knowledge
how
to
advertise
or
give
me
counsel
in
any
time
of
need
which
is
to
be
feared
more
shortly
than
your
Grace
thought
at
the
time
of
my
departing
as
my
mother
Guldford
can
more
plainly
show
your
Grace
than
I
can
write
to
whom
I
beseech
you
to
give
credence

But
for
any
thing
I
might
do
in
no
wise
might
I
have
any
grant
for
her
abode
here
which
I
assure
you
my
lord
is
much
to
my
discomfort
beside
many
other
discomforts
that
you
would
full
little
have
thought

But
I
trust
that
both
I
and
my
said
Lord
shall
see
you
according
as
your
Grace
wrote
in
your
last
letters
unto
my
said
Lord
which
is
the
thing
that
I
desire
more
to
obtain
than
all
the
honour
of
the
World

Your
friend
MARGARET
R.
My
lord
Cardinal
I
recommend
me
heartily
to
you
and
I
am
glad
to
hear
that
you
do
well
and
I
have
received
a
letter
from
you
and
another
from
my
lord
Dakers
whereof
I
believe
you
know
the
effect

Nevertheless
I
am
credibly
informed
that
my
almoner
is
disappointed
of
the
said
prebend
and
that
your
chaplain
has
it
of
the
which
I
marvel
greatly
forasmuch
as
my
said
almoner
has
done
me
good
service
in
this
country
to
the
great
honour
of
the
king
my
brother
and
mine
also
and
that
the
promise
was
made
undesired
of
my
behalf
for
you
were
the
person
that
only
moved
the
king
to
give
it
unto
my
almoner
and
I
am
assured
that
his
grace
would
not
have
varied
without
he
had
been
persuaded
to
the
contrary

Written
this
day
of
March

Whereupon
Sir
I
put
my
lord
of
Suffolk
in
choice
whether
he
would
accomplish
the
marriage
within
four
days
or
else
that
he
should
never
have
enjoyed
me
whereby
I
know
well
that
I
constrained
him
to
break
such
promises
as
he
made
your
grace
as
well
for
fear
of
losing
of
me
as
also
that
I
ascertained
him
that
by
their
consent
I
would
never
come
into
England

Beseeching
you
my
Lord
at
mine
instance
and
for
my
sake
to
be
so
good
Lord
unto
my
servant
John
Palgrave
master
of
art
which
has
done
unto
me
right
good
and
acceptable
service
to
his
and
his
friends'
great
charge
and
on
my
part
as
yet
hitherto
unremembered
as
by
your
good
wisdom
and
provision
to
find
the
means
that
he
may
have
one
of
the
said
benefices

Unto
my
dearest
brother
the
King's
Grace

Yours
MARGARET
R.
To
my
Lord
Cardinal

And
the
gentlemen
which
must
take
pain
to
levy
this
money
amongst
the
King’s
subjects
I
think
shallhave
no
little
business
about
the
same

Out
of
Spain
we
have
news
that
there
is
a
truce
or
abstinence
of
war
taken
between
the emperor
and
them
of
France

For
his
Grace
thinks
it
a
great
hindrance
to
the
come
affairs
that
the Emperor
should
grant
any
such
safe conduct
whereby
there
should
be
any
mutual
intercourse
between
his
subjects
and
their
common
enemies
and
the
commodities
of
France
having
vent
and
utterance
the enemy
thereby
the
better
furnished
of
money
should
be
the
more
able
the
longer
to
maintain
the
war

And
now
he
says
he
is
servant
unto
the Emperors
Majesty
and
is
going
in
to
Spain
with
letters
to
him
and
indeed
he
has
diverse
letters
to
his
Majesty
and
so
was
it
easy
for
him
to
get
if
he
intended
to
deceive
and
mock
as
the
King’s
Grace
thinks
that
he
does

All
which
letters
and
copies
I
have
distinctly
read
unto
his
Grace

And
thus
our
Lord
long
preserve
your
good
Grace
in
honour
and
health

From
Oxford
the
27th
day
of
June

That
you
will
so
specially
tender
me
in
this
behalf
as
to
inform
the
King’s
Highness
of
these
premises
whereby
I
may
the
more
tenderly
be
regarded
of
his
gracious
person
your
word
in
this
shall
be
to
me
a
sure
help
and
God
shall
be
to
you
therefore
a
sure
reward
which
does
promise
good
to
them
that
does
help
poor
forsaken
widows

Wherefore
I
purpose
if
it
shall
so
stand
with
the
King’s
pleasure
whereof
I
pray
you
I
may
be
advertised
by
your
next
letters
after
the
French
King’s
commission
shall be
here
arrived
if
they
vehemently
press
me
to
begin
to
common
with
them
upon
the
King’s
said
entree
for
the
avoiding
of
the
said
suspicion

I
send
unto
the
King’s
Highness
by
my
Lord
of
Exeter
bearer
hereof
certain
of
the
Crowns
of
the
Rose
as
be
newly
struck
and
coined
in
the
King’s
Mint
which
be
of
like
finesse
and
poise
as
the
Crown
Soleil
and
as
you
do
know
the
same
be
proclaimed
to
be
current
after
the
rate
of
4
s
6
d.
apiece

After
my
most
humble
recommendations
Where
as
I
understand
by
the
rapport
of
diverse
such
as
be
my
friends
that
you
be
towards
me
now
as
you
have
been
ever
my
especially
good
master
I
do
therefore
most
humbly
thank
you
beseeching
you
of
your
good
continuance
and
whereas
I
for
your
sundry
benefits
used
unto
me
esteem
my
self
more
bound
to
you
than
to
any
one
man
living
which
hitherto
I
have
had
never
other
ability
to
recompense
but
only
by
my
word
to
declare
it
where
I
have
seen
time
and
place
convenient

Never
shall
there
any
loss
in
this
matter
grieve
me
being
my
self
so
innocent
as
grace
and
I
know
by
the
grace
of
Almighty
God
who
both
bodily
and
ghostly
preserve
you

Master
Cromwell
has
assigned
her
to
the
King's
attorney
for
writings
that
should
be
made
and
he
drives
her
off
that
she
makes
as
much
suit
to
him
now
as
she
did
to
Master
Cromwell

For
in
this
matter
of
the
Nun
of
Canterbury
I
have
unto
your
trusty
Counsellor
master
Thomas
Cromwell
by
my
writing
as
plainly
declared
the
truth
as
*
I
possibly
*
can
which
my
declaration
*
as
I
understand
*
is
made
known
to
your
noble
Grace

Therefore
shall
you
understand
that
on
Friday
last
the
30th
of
April
in
the
afternoon
master
Lieutenant
showd
me
that
Master
Secretary
would
speak
with
me

Whereunto
master
Secretary
answered
that
he
thought
that
this
manner
of
answer
would
not
satisfy
the
King’s
Highness
for
that
his
Grace
expected
a
more
full
answer
and
that
to
the
purpose

I
do
no
body
any
harm
I
say
no
harm
I
think
no
harm
I
wish
every
body
well
I
pray
for
them

My
Lord
whereas
you
charge
me
with
promise
written
with
mine
one
hand
to
change
the
two
years
into
two
months
I
think
you
have
no
such
plain
sentence
written
with
my
hand
I
know
not
whether
you
be
paraphrased
or
not
if
you
be
learned
in
that
science
it
is
possible
you
may
of
one
word
make
a
hole
sentence
and
yet
not
at
all
times
after
the
true
meaning
of
the
writer
as
it
appears
by
this
your
exposition
upon
my
writing

Wherever
of
this
I
shall
beseech
you
to
be
persuaded
ever
surely
to
have
in
me
such
a
heart
and
stomach
as
is
convenient
to
be
in
him
who
to
you
of
all
other
shall
be
most
bound

Sir
as
you
know
since
our
first
acquaintance
and
familiarity
many
letters
there
has
been
at
sundry
times
between
us
written
and
much
communication
there
has
been
also
concerning
the
institution
of
our
lives
with
such
fidelity
ministered
upon
both
parties
as
was
convenient
to
the
sincereness
of
our
hearts
and
minds
but
if
ever

this

sir
I
will
make
an
end

my

all
such

fame
which
by
men
of
corrupt
judgement
not
having
discretion
to
judge
and
discern
between
very
and
true
religion
and
light
and
false
superstition
since
was
in

divulged

utterly
false

of
vanity

Written
in
haste

To
my
welbeloved
sister
Mary

And
thus
as
one
desirous
to
hire
of
your
Majesty’s
health
thought
unfortunate
to
see
it
I
shall
pray
God
for
ever
to
preserve
you

And
thus
I
will
(
troubling
your
Majesty
I
fear
end
with
my
most
humble
thanks

And
now
I
beseech
your
Highness
to
give
me
leave
to
write
what
I
think
touching
your
Majesty’s
letters

Therefore
I
desire
you
as
my
trust
is
that
you
will
be
so
good
aunt
to
him

And
for
the
testimony
hereof
to
the
satisfaction
of
such
as
shall
conceive
any
doubt
herein
We
understand
that
certain
of
our
nobility
have
written
at
this
present
in
some
part
to
admonish
you
of
your
duties
and
to
testify
their
knowledge
of
the
truth
of
our
title
and
right

Which
I
pray
God
be
taken
no
other
ways
that
it
is
meant

And
albeit
we
be
not
of
mind
to
praise
our
said
good
Sister
further
than
shall
come
of
her
own
good
pleasure
to
put
that
matter
in
question

and
for
your
self
we
cannot
but
let
you
know
that
we
hear
out
of
France
such
singular
good
reports
of
your
duty
well
accomplished
towards
your
husband
both
living
and
dead
with
other
your
sober
wise
and
discreet
behaviour
in
that
court
and
country
that
we
think
it
a
part
of
great
contentation
to
us
and
commendation
of
our
country
that
such
a
gentlewoman
has
given
so
manifest
a
testimony
of
virtue
in
such
hard
times
of
adversity

Now
Madame
I
have
promised
you
to
come
to
you
and
having
there
made
my
moan
and
complaint
of
those
rebels
and
they
coming
thither
not
as
possessors
but
as
subjects
to
answer
I
would
have
besought
you
to
hear
my
justification
of
that
which
they
have
falsely
set
forth
against
me
and
if
I
could
not
purge
myself
thereof
you
might
then
discharge
your
hands
of
my
causes
and
let
me
go
for
such
as
I
am

Happen
what
may
happen
I
have
as
lief
to
abide
my
fortune
as
to
seek
it
and
not
find
it

In
that
you
trust
me
I
will
not
(
to
die
for
it
deceive
you
but
from
Donbertran
I
answer
not
when
my
L.
Flemyn
shall be
in
the
Tower
for
they
which
are
within
it
will
not
let
to
receive
succours
if
I
do
not
assure
them
of
yours

to

queen

me
nor
I
can
persuade
you
namely
in
this
language
excuse
my
evil
writing
for
I
never
used
it
before

The

I
therefore
desire

to

me
at
this
present
with
40
pounds
to
supply
me
necessary
wants

I
bid
you
farewell
this
16th
of
October
1583

I
hope
you
more
esteem
your
honour
than
to
give
it
such
a
stain
since
you
have
protested
so
often
to
have
taken
these
Lords
for
your
most
affectionate
subjects
and
to
have
done
all
for
your
best

Mr.
Broughton
I
forgot
in
my
letters
to
write
for
Mr.
Aldersey's
bills
to
be
sent
over
in
haste
by
Merick

I
am
sure
there
be
a
100
of
these
already
delivered
and
the
rest
will be
before
I
can
revoke
them
having
appointed
the
18th
and
20th
of
the
next
month
for
their
repair
hither
with
all
their
furniture

Whereupon
this
sudden
change
does
grow
Mr
secretary
I
can
not
imagine
neither
will
I
meddle
withal
but
must
obey
her
Majesty’s
pleasure
if
she
have
determined
any
alteration
which
I
desire
to
hear
from
you
for
if
I
come
to
the
court
it
must
more
easily
break
out
as
it
will
notwithstanding
and
I
can
but
grief
at
the
miserable
estate
of
the
poor
afflicted
as
for
my
own
it
must
be
as
the
potters
vessel
etc.

I
trust
my
good
Lord
now
that
I
have
taken
this
voyage
upon
me
to
serve
her
Majesty
as
she
has
commanded
your
Lordship
will
be
mindful
of
me
poor
man
but
of
the
cause
committed
now
to
my
delinge
chiefly

My
Lord
no
man
feels
comfort
but
they
that
have
cause
of
grief
and
no
men
have
so
much
need
of
relief
and
comfort
as
those
that
go
in
these
doubtful
services

They
so
shook
him
up
and
with
such
terms
naming
her
Majesty
in
scorn
as
they
took
it
as
they
hurled
him
his
letters
and
bid
him
content
himself
they
would
first
discharge
all
the
least
duties
whatsoever
to
her
majesty
before
they
would
hear
him

God
send
her
Majesty
to
think
of
his
merciful
dealings
accordingly

Some
her
Majesty
did
set
down
as
I
take
it
above
70000
pounds

Thus
referring
you
for
the
rest
to
Mr.
Davyson
at
his
coming
I
will
take
my
leave
protesting
my
whole
care
and
endeavour
his
to
do
her
Majesty
acceptable
service
or
else
God
not
to
let
me
live
if
otherwise
it
should
be

The
circumstance
it
may
please
you
to
have
of
this
bearer

And
Mr.
Quarles
has
sent
down
divers
supplies
more
than
allowance
for
the
numbers
were
great
before
we
entered
into
the
six
weeks'
victuals

It
might
have
bred
some
mischief
but
it
was
quickly
put
out

My
Lord
on
Wednesday
last
I
went
to
Harwich
to
see
the
town
and
the
haven
which
I
had
not
seen
this
27
years

My
good
Lord
God
send
you
ever
well
to
do
and
so
I
bid
your
Lordship
most
heartily
farewell

I
would
fain
keep
the
Narrow
Seas
three
or
four
months
I
persuade
myself
I
shall
do
some
service

If
it
were
not
for
you
I
should
live
in
a
dead
place
for
hearing
of
anything

I
will
have
a
watch
on
them

Sir
I
had
forgotten
in
my
last
letter
to
answer
the
matter
you
did
write
in
touching
Captain
Morgan
my
man

I
do
assure
you
they
live
here
bountifully
and
it
will
be
hard
finding
of
such
noblemen
as
these
be
so
well
affected
to
this
service
and
that
will
love
the
sea
so
well
as
they
do

My
honourable
and
good
Lord
I
have
received
your
letter
even
as
I
was
weighing
to
go
out
and
for
the
first
part
I
am
most
heartily
to
give
your
Lordship
thanks
for
your
honourable
favour

And
so
my
Lord
having
no
more
leisure
to
write
at
large
being
under
sail
I
bid
your
Lordship
most
heartily
farewell

If
your
Majesty
thought
it
meet
it
would
not
be
amiss
you
sent
presently
to
Denmark
to
understand
the
truth
and
to
deal
with
their
King
according
to
your
Majesty's
great
wisdom

Thirdly
at
Calais
by
fire
we
forced
them
to
cut
many
of
their
cables
whereby
they
lost
many
of
their
anchors
which
of
necessity
they
must
seek
to
supply

The
winter
will
overtake
them
else
in
those
parts

For
that
we
were
very
near
to
set
sail
I
most
humbly
beseech
your
Honour
to
pardon
my
pen
for
that
I
am
forced
to
write
the
very
copy
of
that
letter
which
I
have
sent
to
my
Lord
Chancellor

Your
Honour's
faithfully
to
be
commanded
FRANCIS
DRAKE

And
yet
with
my
consent
we
ought
much
more
to
have
regard
unto
the
Duke
of
Parma
and
his
soldiers
than
to
the
Duke
of
Siding
and
his
ships
for
that
our
sands
will
take
a
strong
party
with
us
against
his
great
ships
under
water

I
think
it
one
of
the
best
services
we
can
have
in
hand

should
now
give
glory
unto
his
greatness
for
penetrating
in
his
power
his
hand
lies
heavy
upon
me
he
has
spoken
unto
me
with
a
voice
of
thunder
and
I
have
felt
he
is
a
God
that
can
punish
enemies

With
you
I
join
young
Juvenal
that
biting
satirist
that
lastly
with
me
together
writ
a
comedy

For
other
new
comers
I
leave
them
to
the
mercy
of
these
painted
monsters
who
I
doubt
not
will
drive
the
bestminded
to
despise
them
for
the
rest
it
skills
not
though
they
make
a
ieast
at
them

Desirous
that
you
should
live
though
himself
be
dying
ROBERT

Thus
God
has
cast
me
down
that
I
might
be
humbled
and
punished
me
for
example
of
others’
sin
and
although
he
suffers
me
in
this
world
to
perish
without
succour
yet
trust
I
in
the

to
come
to
find
mercy
by
the
merits
of
my
Saviour

you

No
no
fair
witty
and
worthy
mistress
I
have
too
long
deceived
myself
because
when
I
was
with
you
my
heart
was
so
fixed
upon
you
that
I
could
not
look
into
myself
now
I
come
to
pose
my
disordered
study
from
that
survey
I
came
to
behold
my
distempered
self
I
find
neither
nobleness
nor
richness
nor
government
nor
knowledge
nor
eloquence
nor
comeliness
nor
any
thing
love
worthy
in
me
for
my
wealth
you
may
disdain
me
for
my
behaviour
you
may
shun
me
for
my
wit
you
may
laugh
at
me
for
my
speech
you
may
reprehend
me
for
my
letters
you
may
be
weary
of

for
my

J:H
SIR
Although
the
answer
I
received
from
you
two
days
since
gave
my
small
encouragement
to
flatter
myself
that
any
importunity
I
could
make
should
be
able
to
appease
the
scandal
you
had
conceived
to
be
given
you
by
my
unfortunate
husband
yet
had
it
not
pleased
God
to
power
upon
me
one
affliction
after
an
other
and
to
add
to
the
immeasurable
sorrows
of
my
heart
so
violent
a
sickness
as
I
am
not
able
of
myself
to
stir
out
of
my
bed
I
had
presented
unto
your
view
the
image
of
the
importunate
widow
mentioned
in
the
Scripture
and
had
never
ceased
to
pester
you
with
my
complains
till
you
had
afforded
me
some
assurance
that
whatsoever
respects
might
dehorte
you
from
so
much
as
wishing
my
husband's
good
yet
that
an
afflicted
and
woeful
lady
should
not
wholly
loose
her
labour
or
return
desperate
of
such
comforts
at
the
last
year
you
so
honourably
ministered
unto
me
in
a
great
affliction
though
differing
from
this
in
quality

Losses
of
men
somewhat
equal
but
the

"
Your
true
certain
friend
"
John
Donne

Most
truly
honourable
/
it
has
still
been
the
tyranny
of
my
fortune
so
to
oppress
my
endeavours
that
before
I
can
show
my
self
grateful
(
in
the
least
for
former
benefits
I
am
enforced
to
provoke
your
bounties
for
more

If
I
have
been
misreported
to
his
Majesty
the
punishment
I
now
suffer
may
I
hope
merit
more
of
his
princely
favour
when
he
shall
know
me
truly
eerie
accusation
does
not
condemn

The
noble
favours
you
have
done
us
most
worthy
Lord
can
not
be
so
concealed
or
removed
but
that
they
have
broke
in
upon
us
even
where
we
lye
double
bound
to
their
comforts
nor
can
we
doubt
but
he
who
has
so
far
and
freely
adventured
to
the
relief
of
our
virtue
will
go
on
to
the
utmost
release
of
it
and
though
I
know
your
Lordship
has
been
far
from
doing
any
thing
herein
to
your
own
ambition
yet
be
pleased
to
take
this
protestation
that
(
next
his
Majesty’s
favour
I
shall
not
covet
that
thing
more
in
the
world
than
to
express
the
lasting
gratitude
I
have
conceived
in
soul
towards
your
Lordship

And
though
we
know
it
only
the
property
of
men
guilty
and
worthy
of
punishment
to
invoke
mercy
yet
now
it
might
relieve
us
who
have
only
our
fortunes
made
our
fault
and
are
indeed
vexed
for
other
men’s
licences

And
so
much
I
have
sent
to
some
of
them

But
remember
that
nothing
is
flattery
which
the
speaker
believes
and
of
the
grossest
flattery
there
is
this
good
use
that
they
tell
us
what
we
should
be

Of
which
since
I
have
been
a
witness
and
subject
not
to
tell
you
sometimes
that
by
your
influence
and
example
I
have
attained
to
such
a
step
of
goodness
as
to
be
thankful

loth
to
accuse

Sir
I
sat
up
last
night
till
past
12
to
write
out
this
sheet
and
had
not

desire
to
make
you
part
of
amends
for
your
great
friendship
to
me

my
labour

could

the
last
scene
which
that
you
may
see
finished
I
send
you
the
full
sheet

I
was
writing
as

not
prevented
I
had

SIR,—If
my
business
had
not
been
much
and
my
stay
at
Redgrave
very
little
I
had
purposed
to
have
seen
you
at
Palgrave

I
am
sorry
that
your
business
does
carry
you
another
way
that

shall
not
see

end

to
deserve
by
any

day
I
could
not
meet
you
because
the
rest

company
could
not
be
there

tomorrow
my
Lady
of
Roxborough's
business
whom
I
must
not
forsake
will
pass
a
trial
so
as
I
can
neither
go
my
journey
nor
hope
to
see
you
if
you
go
away
on
Wednesday
before
your
return
into
the
country
which
I
am
extreme
sorry
for
but
I
will
in
the
morning
send
to
you
again
either
my
farewell
or
to
receive
the
good
news
that
you
go
not
so
soon
which

I
will
God
willing
come
to
you
on
Wednesday
till
when
I
kiss
your
hands

To
my
dear
and
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

This
dull
town
affords
nothing
worthy
the
writing

there
is
almost
nobody
of
quality
left
in
it

Harington
House
this
26th
of
May
1617

Some
other
time
I
hope
will
be
more
fortunate
to
me
than
this
any
way
is
and
none
shall
I
esteem
more
so
than
that
which
may
bring
forth
an
opportunity
for
me
to
testify
the
unfeignedness
of
that
respect
has
so
often
been
vowed
unto
you
by
your
most
affectionate
and
faithful
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

this
11th
of
April
1618

If
any
copies
of
them
be
desired
I
will
return
such
as
he
must
extraordinarily
well
know
paintings
that
shall
distinguish
them
from
the
originals

Even
at
such
a
time
as
I
could
not
be
pleased
with
any
meat
to
please
my
stomach
notwithstanding
I
was
sick
of
a
chicken
yesternight
yet
I
could
eat
this
with
desire
and
yet
not
sick
of
it
but
my
fits
never
of
me

To
my
loving
honourable
sister
the
Lady
Cornwallis
give
these

I
send
this
messenger
to
bring
me
word
how
you
Mister
Bacon
and
all
your
little
ones
do
and
by
him
send
my
servant
Fred
a
sword
to
defend
him
from
the
malice
of
the
bucks
in
this
their
choleric
season

To
my
noble
and
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis
at
Broome

And
so
Sir
wishing
us
the
continuance
of
blessed
peace
at
home

humbly
rest
at
your
commandments

I
am
sure
you
believe
there
are
not
many
for
whom
I
durst
engage
my
word
to
you
so
freely
and
therefore
will
easily
judge
that
I
offer
you
the
service
but
of
two
but
if
those
two
give
you
not
a
good
account
of
what
I
promise
in
their
names
set
it
on
my
score
as
a
falsehood

House
in
haste
this

morning

My
sister
desires
to
be
remembered
to
you
and
my
brother
not
forgetting
my
little
nephew

And
for
the
rest
philosophy
shall
be
my
reward
which
though
it
cannot
keep
me
from
need
yet
it
will
teach
me
not
to
envy
those
that
abound

Right
honourable
This
is
only
to
signify
unto
his
Majesty
that
by
God's
favour
within
two
or
three
days
after
the
date
thereof
we
shall
depart
from
hence
so
as
my
next
will
be
from
Augusta
where
there
is
as
you
know
a
feat
to
be
done
for
which
the
party
is
well
prepared

Yet
God
that
sees
no
affliction
to
work
sufficiently
upon
me
has
this
last
night
added
another
heavy
one
to
my
former
woe
having
taken
my
Lord
Chamberlain's
son

DEAR
CORNWALLIS
I
KNOW
that
by
this
time
I
have
deserved
and
undergone
much
of
your
censure
if
I
have
not
lost
all
your
favour
which
to
redeem
I
do
protest
unto
you
that
the
only
cause
you
have
been
so
long
without
hearing
from
me
was
that
I
was
ashamed
to
send
till
I
could
return
you
that
part
of
your
wealth
you
have
so
long
been
pleased
to
trust
me
with
to
whom
alone
I
had
been
beholding
for
a
courtesy
of
this
nature

For
the
first
I
assure
you
your
new
nephew
is
as
fine
and
towardly
a
youth
as
any
I
know
and
for
the
other
my
Lord
Hamilton
my
Lord
Chamberlain
and
my
Lord
of
Montgomery
have
done
their
best
and
will
do
still
to
keep
off
all
the
blows
they
can
others'
malice
aims
at
her
but
what
the
success
will
be
I
dare
not
promise
so
strongly
is
the
King
incensed
and
so
bitter
yet
in
the
prosecution
but
I
will
assure
you
if
there
were
no
other
ground
but
that
of
her
blood
it
shall
make
me
keep
warmest
in
my
friend’s
desires
to
save
her
from
public
shame
and
I
beseech
you
since
your
own
virtue
exempts
you
from
all
reproach
in
her
be
so
just
to
yourself
as
not
to
be
afflicted
with
her
danger

This
done
I
intend
to
turn
Combe
wholly
into
money
both
to
make
myself
a
free
woman
from
debt
and
with
the
rest
of
it
to
raise
as
good
an
estate
for
life
as
I
can
having
now
none
but
myself
to
provide
for
those
designs
I
had
for
my
niece
being
crossed
by
her
father's
untowardness
and
her
own
portion
being
sufficient
for
any
match

Do
me
the
favour
to
recommend
me
affectionately
to
Mister
Bacon
and
thank
him
for
his
kind
remembering
me

Therefore
dear
Cornwallis
let
not
this
melancholy
prevail
with
you
to
the
begetting
or
nourishing
of
those
mistrusts
will
turn
more
to
your
hurt
than
that
you
fear
which
I
hope
will
pass
with
safety
and
end
to
your
comfort
unto
which
if
I
could
tell
how
here
or
there
to
advise
anything
I
would
affectionately
endeavour
at
in
absence
and
readily
undertake
a
longer
journey
to
you
than
it
is
to
Broome
for
though
I
have
long
suffered
under
a
condition
has
maimed
me
of
all
means
in
real
effects
to
express
it
and
has
almost
made
me
hate
fruitless
professions
yet
there
is
no
friend
more
sensible
of
what
they
owe
to
another
nor
fuller
of
earnest
desires
to
deserve
well
of
them
than
my
heart
can
witness
I
am
towards
you
to
whom
I
am
not
in
so
much
despair
of
making
it
appear
as
I
have
been
nor
I
hope
are
you
less
confident
that
it
is
an
unfeigned
truth
that
I
am
Your
most
affectionately
faithful
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

Therefore
again
I
pray
you
to
resolve
to
change
place
for
a
while
some
divertissements
at
the
least
you
will
find
here
from
whence
I
shall
not
I
think
remove
till
after
Midsummer
term

My
Lord
of
Buckingham
has
made
his
declaration
to
the
parliament
who
yet
applaud
it
because
it
tends
to
the
final
breach
of
the
match
with
Spain

I
presented
him
with
your
casket
which
in
respect
it
was
yours
I
could
hardly
fasten
upon
him
had
not
Mister
Short
witnessed
that
it
was
before
set
apart
for
him

Harington
House
this
23rd
of
June
1624

Dear
Madam
return
my
thanks
and
affectionate
salutations
to
your
husband
and
believe
that
though
it
will
be
with
a
sadder
heart
I
shall
ever
continue
to
love
you
as
your
kindness
has
from
time
to
time
given
me
cause
which
is
all
so
unfortunate
a
woman
as
I
am
can
deserve
it
by
but
of
that
you
shall
never
want
any
real
proof
can
be
given
by
Your
most
affectionate
and
thankful
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

Since
your
going
my
Lord
of
Kensington
is
come
out
of
France
who
brings
word
that
they
are
so
desirous
of
that
match
as
I
believe
it
will
presently
be
both
concluded
and
she
here
ere
long
upon
less
ill
conditions
than
Spain
insisted
on
for
matter
of
religion

The
King
is
pleased
to
use
my
Lord
Chamberlain
that
is
as
graciously
as
any
man
which
gives
many
much
confidence
seeing
the
King
so
well
inclined
to
favour
honest
men
which
he
is
known
to
be
and
one
that
will
never
abuse
his
trust

But
now
I
have
many
reasons
to
assure
myself
he
expected
not
to
live
out
this
year
though
he
was
sparing
to
utter
that
to
those
he
knew
loved
him
best
for
grieving
them
yet
now
I
call
to
mind
many
speeches
of
his
I
heeded
not
when
they
were
spoken
might
have
made
me
take
more
hold
what
his
opinion
was
of
his
short
continuance
on
earth
where
he
has
not
left
such
another
nor
any
creature
so
great
a
loser
as
I
in
the
death
of
a
friend
whom
if
it
had
pleased
God
to
have
longer
spared
us
would
at
this
time
both
to
the
public
and
his
private
friends
have
been
that
we
must
not
look
to
see
any
other

Thus
with
the
remembrance
of
my
never
enough
acknowledged
love
and
service
to
you
I
rest
your
most
faithful
friend
and
humble
servant

The
King’s
funeral
sermon
is
come
forth
wherein
the
Lord
Keeper
has
showed
a
great
deal
of
wit
and
learning
in
comparing
King
James
to
King
Salomon
in
all
his
actions
saving
his
vices

From
London
this
21st
of
May
1625

The
French
king
promises
to
overtake
her
at
Amiens
and
there
take
his
leave
but
the
Queen
regnant
and
Queen
mother
accompany
her
to
the
seaside
so
that
we
are
like
to
have
three
Queens
at
Bullen
to
answer
the
three
kings
of
Cullen

Young
Master
Fanshaw
recommends
this
letter
to
his
brother
if
he
may
be
found
for
it
seems
he
obscures
himself
and
would
not
that
any
of
his
friends
should
know
what
becomes
of
him
nor
what
course
he
means
to
take
or
under
what
captain
colonel
or
general
he
has
put
himself
that
they
may
know
how
to
hear
of
him
If
you
can
learn
by
any
that
come
from
the
army
or
by
any
other
means
what
he
does
it
will be
held
for
a
great
favour
from
your
Lordship

My
hope
is
to
see
you
here
this
day
sevennight
or
tomorrow
sevennight
and
I
pray
God
give
us
a
happy
meeting
and
preserve
you
safe
which
will
be
the
great
comfort
of
Your
most
true
affectionate
wife
BRILLIANA
HARLEY

I
assure
myself
I
have
your
prayers
because
you
have
so
great
a
part
of
mine
and
I
bless
God
that
you
enjoy
your
health
which
I
beg
of
you
to
take
care
of

In
the
meantime
my
Lord
Marshall
remains
at
the
Tower
though
my
Lord
Chamberlain
is
labouring
to
get
his
prison
changed
to
his
own
house
at
Highgate

To
my
dear
husband
Sir
Robert
Harley

I
send
it
up
now
because
I
think
carriage
when
it
is
ready
to
drink
does
it
hurt
therefore
and
please
you
to
let
it
rest
and
than
taste
it
if
it
is
good
I
pray
you
let
my
father
have
it
because
he
spoke
to
me
for
such
meat

If
you
think
it
will
not
displease
him
and
it
may
anything
at
all
set
forward
your
business
I
pray
you
deliver
it
to
him

He
begins
now
to
delight
in
reading
and
that
is
the
book
I
would
have
him
place
his
delight
in

I
give
you
many
thanks
for
this
your
desire
which
you
favour
me
with
all
in
letting
me
hear
of
my
nephew's
good
health
which
I
am
very
glad
of

Your
Ladyship’s
to
be
commanded
BRIDGET
LONG

Sir
William
Plaiter
will
acquaint
you
with
the
business
of
my
Lord
Banning's
daughters
which
we
think
very
good
marriages
and
not
hard
to
be
gotten
by
you
because
you
have
a
great
many
friends
to
make
way
for
you
as
my
Lord
of
Dorset
and
Sir
Henry
German
that
are
near
kinsmen
to
them

I
spoke
with
Mister
Chitting
about
Sir
Thomas
Barrington’s
niece
he
seems
to
think
she
is
worth
seven
thousand
pounds
but
he
will
write
to
you
the
particulars

Sir
William
Plaiters
is
in
this
town
and
has
been
ever
since
he
came
from
you
but
he
has
been
ill
of
late
with
sore
eyes

So
I
altogether
concealed
our
name
and
urged
no
further
because
we
have
little
reason
to
undervalue
ourselves
so
much
as
to
importune
that
which
so
much
deserves
to
be
met
at
least
half
way
in

I
hope
a
better
will
come
in
your
way
in
the
meantime
and
if
a
good
offer
comes
I
presume
you
will
not
delay
it
for
it
is
hard
to
meet
with
one
whose
person
and
portion
is
without
exception

My
mother
is
very
ill
with
the
gout
I
am
afraid
I
shall
not
enjoy
her
long

we
can
prevail
but
this
much
further
with
you
that
you
will
extend
the
same
kindness
towards
your
daughter
in
law
and
so
receive
them
both
into
your
motherly
care
you
shall
put
such
an
obligation
upon
us
as
we
shall
never
forget
but
remember
upon
all
occasions
wherein
our
favour
can
be
of
any
use
unto
you
and
with
this
assurance
we
commit
you
to
the
protection
of
the
Almighty

I
cannot
but
hope
to
see
you
at
London
shortly
where
I
fear
I
shall
be
enforced
to
stay
till
the
end
of
next
term
to
see
if
I
can
bring
my
mother's
business
to
something
for
yet
we
have
done
little
by
reason
my
Lady
Weston
was
out
of
town
and
so
could
never
come
to
have
my
Lord
and
she
together

My
cousin
Peter
Meautys
has
your
letters
and
a
copy
of
the
paper
you
sent
he
stays
but
for
a
wind

For
the
money
when
she
could
get
it
you
should
have
it
and
if
in
the
meantime
the
King
and
Queen's
promise
from
their
own
mouths
to
you
will
any
way
give
you
content
she
will
not
fail
to
procure
that
and
she
desired
me
to
write
you
word
so
which
I
made
answer
it
was
better
for
her
to
write
it
herself

ACCORDING
to
my
promise
I
will
not
fail
to
let
you
understand
of
my
proceedings
last
week
which
was
the
first
opportunity
I
could
get
to
come
unto
the
speech
of
my
Lord
of
Dorset
who
was
pleased
to
tell
me
how
much
his
Lordship
had
travelled
in
Mister
Meautys's
behalf
to
his
Majesty
for
the
making
of
a
baronet
the
which
his
Majesty
will
by
no
means
grant
so
for
that
I
am
already
answered

Were
it
that
I
did
know
how
to
help
myself
I
would
not
bespeak
one
hour's
time
that
you
have
prefixed
but
now
I
hope
that
you
will
take
me
into
your
consideration

To
my
dear
and
much
honoured
sister
Lady
Bacon

For
my
dear
husband
Sir
Robert
Harley
Knight

She
was
bread
with
my
old
lady
Manering

I
thank
you
for
my
very
fine
waistcoat
by
this
carrier
is
sent
up

clock
and
doublet

sent

DEAR
MOTHER
I
HAD
last
Saturday
brought
me
by
a
Londoner
a
bill
of
exchange
as
they
call
it
for
two
hundred
pounds
presently
to
be
paid
to
the
bearer
thereof
because
he
had
already
had
the
money

Here
is
much
talking
of
foreign
wars
and
armies
joining
yet
no
certainty
but
I
humbly
beseech
God
keep
our
Fred
from
amongst
them
and
all
harm

St.

Recommend
my
hearty
love
to
Mr.
Busse
Mr.
Beadly
and
my
other
good
friends

But
when
I
think
how
troublesome
I
have
been
and
how
unpleasing
company
I
must
yet
be
to
everybody
I
recall
my
wishes
and
hope
that
God
will
give
me
that
happiness
when
I
shall
be
more
capable
of
it
than
now
I
could
being
so
often
ill
but
Madam
if
I
do
think
of
anything
that
my
stomach
will
serve
me
to
eat
I
will
make
such
use
of
your
kind
favour
for
which
I
humbly
thank
your
Ladyship
that
you
shall
be
sure
to
hear
of
me

The
Queen
went
this
day

Wallingford

chair

Dear
Sister
if
you
please
send
me
word
how
my
Hercules
does
to
whom
I
send
my
blessing

Madam
I
received
I
humbly
thank
you
your
ring
by
Tom
Howard

he
told
me
that
your
Ladyship
meant
to
go
through
that
night

If
you
want
anything
let
me
know
it

Bromton
Nov.
13
1638

I
heard
that
there
was
a
cardinal’s
cape
brought
to
the
custom
house
valued
at
a
high
rate
but
none
would
own
it
and
to
requite
your
intelligence
I
let
you
know
what
I
hear

My
dear
Ned
you
may
see
how
willing
I
am
to
discourse
with
you
that
have
spun
out
my
letter
to
this
length

Truly
than
this
I
find
that
He
gives
springs
in
a
dry
barren
wilderness
where
no
water
is

One
beam
in
a
dark
place
has
exceeding
much
refreshment
in
it
blessed
be
His
name
for
shining
upon
so
dark
a
heart
as
mine

Salute
your
husband
and
sister
from
me
he
is
not
a
man
of
his
word

The
subject
of
it
is
to
make
a
Declaration
against
the
orders
of
Parliament
which
are
made
without
the
king

The
Q
for
me
to
signify
to
Lord
Chamberlain

My
dear
sister
the
Lady
Bacon
at
Culford
these

If
you
do
I
must
be
pardoned
what
my
relation
to
the
public
calls
for

To
my
honoured
friends
the
Deputy
Lieutenants
for
the
County
of
Suffolk

Gentlemen
command
Your
servant
OLIVER
CROMWELL

I
beseech
you
therefore
consider
this
gentleman
and
the
soldiers
and
if
it
be
possible
make
up
his
company
a
hundred-and-twenty
and
send
them
away
with
what
expedition
is
possible

Some
time
they
must
have
for
exercise

I
protest
if
it
were
for
myself
I
would
not
move
you

I
am
neglected
exceedingly

My
estate
is
little

He
has
not
one
able
to
put
on
'that
business.'
The
force
will
fall
if
some
help
not

But
we
got
to
horse
and
retreated
in
good
order
with
the
safety
of
all
our
horse
of
the
association
not
losing
four
of
them
that
I
hear
of
and
we
got
five
of
theirs

The
horses
that
his
coronet
Boulry
took
he
will
put
himself
upon
that
issue
for
them
all

Let
them
therefore
if
I
be
thought
worthy
of
any
favour
leave
your
country
with
your
good
wishes
and
a
blessing

Not
that
I
would
for
ten
thousand
horses
have
the
horse
to
my
own
private
benefit
saving
to
make
use
of
him
for
the
public
for
I
will
most
gladly
return
the
value
of
him
to
the
state

Admit
he
be
shall
that
render
him
incapable
to
serve
the
public

If
there
be
any
other
offence
to
be
charged
upon
him
that
must
in
a
judicial
way
receive
determination

This
is
all
but
that
I
am
ready
to
serve
you
and
rest
Your
loving
friend
OLIVER
CROMWELL

I
have
offered
him
now
another
place
of
meeting
to
come
to
which
I
suppose
he
will
not
deny
me
and
that
to
be
tomorrow

Coll

Sir
I
have
a
great
desire
to
shift
my
residence
a
while
and
to
live
a
month
or
two
in
Norwich
by
you
where
I
may
have
the
happiness
of
your
neighbourhood

Camb

I
have
taken
the
boldness
to
write
the
same
by
my
Lord
Gerard
to
the
King
who
I
believe
will
be
with
you
as
soon
as
this
letter
for
he
went
from
hence
upon
Saturday
last

I
pray
tell
my
Lady
Hide
I
am
very
glad
she
is
so
well
come
to
Cologne

There
is
little
news
here
the
King
of
Sweden
has
born
a
son
to
him
and
has
and
prospers
exceedingly

She
sent
another
account
than
that
to
the
Ambassador
as
you
may
imagine
but
the
landgrave
wrote
the
truth
to
his
niece

Princess
of
Tarente

Mr.
Secretary
I
thank
you
both
for
the
good
news
you
write
to
Sir
Charles
Cottrell
out
of
Holland
and
for
your
letter
I
received
this
morning
with
the
relation
of
the
defeat
before
Arras

Indorsed
7th
of
September
1654

Their
agent
in
Sueden
write
to
the
States
General
that
Sir
George
Fleetwood
brother
to
him
that
is
Lieutenant
of
Ireland
told
him
that
he
knew
Cromwell
had
said
he
would
keep
the
peace
with
the
States
no
longer
then
he
found
it
good
for
his
interests
and
would
break
with
the
first
occasion
that
he
can
for
the
good
of
his
design

Some
in
a
ship
come
out
of
England
say
that
the
mock
Parliament
begins
to
dispute
their
privileges
with
Cromwell
but
I
fear
they
will
but
too
well
agree

Sure
Dick
Harding
has
grown
a
fish
in
his
baths
for
he
is
as
mute
as
one
tell
him
so
from
me

I
pray
tell
your
daughter
all
this
for
I
had
sealed
her
letter
before
I
had
the
certainty
of
the
news

I
have
written
thus
to
your
daughter

desire

I

to

of

what

the

opportunity

more
to

the
keeping

satisfaction

that
this

employed

he
was
in
this
parliament
to
continue
you
a
garrison

(
My
Lord
Bellasis
is
coming
down
within
three
or
four
days)

We
do
not
perceive
but
that
we
shall
rise
at
our
day

Yesterday
(
the
excise
of
beer
and
ale
being
otherwise
expired
his
Majesty
came
about
noon
to
the
Lords’
House
and
passed
only
those
two
bills
of
the
two
moieties
of
that
excise

For
though
nothing
is
too
much
for
so
gracious
a
prince
as
his
Majesty
has
been
all
along
to
us
yet
'it is
good
to
leave
something
to
give
hereafter
and
not
to
endanger
the
peoples
good
will
by
taking
their
benevolence

But
I
believe
it
will
not
signify
much

I
send
you
these
proclamations

Insomuch
that
this
last
parliament
in
a
case
of
the
like
nature
for
Royston
nothing
could
be
done
till
that
were
first
done
and
the
want
of
two
or
three
hands
concerned
did
put
a
stop
for
some
time
to
that
business

We
beseech
you
be
mindful
that
the
29th

May
be
kept
for
a
thanksgiving
according
to
the

in

MY
DEAR
FRIEND,I
am
more
afflicted
than
I
could
have
imagined
anything
in
the
world
could
have
made
me
after
the
recovery
of
a
very
troublesome
and
painful
indisposition
but
now
that
the
violence
of
that
is
abated
you
involve
me
in
a
more
insupportable
trouble
than
any
I
ever
felt
by
the
despair
you
put
me
in
of
a
happiness
I
thought
myself
sure
of
and
instead
of
using
that
freedom
with
me
that
I
have
ever
practised
in
all
my
concerns
towards
you
you
now
begin
to
put
me
with
unfriendly
excuses
by
telling
me
that
though
you
do
not
think
Mrs.
(
Joist
the
wisest
woman
in
her
country
yet
you
think
she
has
not
deserved
such
an
enemy
as
G

I
have
a
great
many
beaux
at
her
service
whose
company
I
desire
inform
yourself
and
send
me
word
when
my
coach
shall
meet
her

Aug.
the
10th
1664

It
seems
it is
true
that
my
Aunt
Temple
comes
away
for
my
cousin
Mary
Hammond
writes
my
Aunt
word
it
she
and
my
Lady
Waller
were
at
Battersay
to
see
my
uncle
and
where
they
told
her
they
expected
her
very
suddenly

He
had
as
much
at
Sadler's
brother
and
has
as
good
as
L16
where
he
now
is

Goodnight
my
dearest
I
am
Yours
D.
T

I
am
much
obliged
to
anybody
for
enquiring
where
I
am
and
indeed
if
I
could
give
any
account
of
what
I
do
here
I
should
be
better
satisfied
but
I
am
good
for
nothing
everywhere
and
you
will
have
a
hard
task
to
prove
there
is
better
company
where
there
is
neither
the
conversation
of
towns
nor
the
innocence
of
the
fields
but
a
certain
kind
of
busy
drudgery
to
the
world
of
Fashion
for
that
pitiful
nothing
that
men
call
pre-eminence
with
the
combined
incursions
of
people
who
can
neither
speak
nor
hold
their
tongue
and
yet
I
could
endure
the
sight
of
all
this
here
rather
than
be
any
more
embarquee
dans
une
affaire
si
mechante
as
the
combatting
giants
and
seeing
them
devour
the
reputations
of
the
innocent
if
I
did
not
consider
that
by
coming
to
the
place
where
these
things
are
I
shall
be
nearer
the
conversation
of
some
particular
excellent
friends
(
among
whom
I
assure
you
Mrs.
Temple
has
a
most
eminent
room
which
may
both
improve
and
delight
me
and
they
so
much
(
bias
my
inclination
that
I
cannot
but
wish
Mr.
Philips
his
occasions
may
permit
him
to
give
me
that
opportunity
this
spring
and
if
they
do
you
are
sure
to
be
tormented
with
me
so
much
that
I
think
you
are
concerned
to
wish
they
may
not
but
in
earnest
for
aught
I
perceive
I
must
never
show
any
face
there
or
among
any
reasonable
people
again
for
some
most
dishonest
person
has
got
some
collection
of
my
poems
as
I
hear
and
has
delivered
them
to
a
printer
who
I
hear
is
just
upon
putting
them
out
and
this
has
so
extremely
disturbed
me
both
to
have
my
private
folly
so
unhandsomely
exposed
and
the
belief
that
I
believe
the
most
part
of
the
world
are
apt
enough
to
believe
that
I
connived
at
this
ugly
accident
that
I
have
been
on
the
rack
ever
since
I
heard
it
though
I
have
written
to
Col

She
has
danced
country
dances
two
or
three
times
of
late
-
but
not
the
King
at
all

I
present
my
services
to
your
brother
and
sister

If
you
are
as
diligent
to
my
ill
letters
as
others
that
are
so
it is
as
much
as
is
due
to
me
though
I
am
your
Ladyship's
very
affectionate
servant

Without
this
declaration
I
hope
I
am
sufficiently
secure
never
to
run
the
hazard
of
being
censured
that
way
since
I
cannot
suspect
my
friends
of
so
much
unkindness
nor
myself
of
the
vanity
to
wish
fame
on
so
doubtful
a
foundation
as
the
caprice
of
mankind

I
pray
that
God
would
inspire
you
with
his
graces
and
blesses
you

I
doubt
it
will
hinder
the
bill
from
passing
with
us
Sir
John
Pitman
who
serves
for
Leicester
was
yesterday
suspended
from

privilege

Humes

notorious

he

prisoner
for
debt
&
thus
by
Sir
Johns
procurement
has
escaped
his
Creditors

Sir
I
must
believe
you
are
very
busy
hearing
so
seldom
from
you
and
that
you
are
much
in
the
esteem
of
Dr.
Bathurst
since
he
judges
so
favourably
of
your
friends

Sir
When
I
have
assured
you
that
my
usual
indisposition
has
treated
me
so
severely
this
winter
that
I
have
had
little
leisure
to
think
of
any
thing
but
the
means
of
gaining
health
and
ease
I
am
persuaded
my
thoughts
which
was
the
greatest
captain
Caesar
or
Pompey
whether
Mr.
De
Rosny
was
not
a
great
politician
a
brave
soldier
and
the
best
servant
that
ever
prince
had
for
capacity
fidelity
and
steadiness
a
man
strangely
disinterested
infinitely
fortunate
and
every
way
qualified
to
serve
such
a
master
as
was
Henry
the
Great
who
notwithstanding
human
frailties
way
worthy
to
be
faithfully
dealt
with
since
he
knew
how
to
judge
and
to
reward

Dear
Savile
Do
a
charity
becoming
one
of
your
pious
principles
in
preserving
your
humble
servant
Rochester
from
the
imminent
peril
of
sobriety
which
for
want
of
good
wine
more
than
company
(
for
I
drink
like
a
hermit
betwixt
God
and
my
own
conscience
is
very
like
to
befall
me

very
often
take
some
opportunity
to
talk
to
her
about
what
I
spoke
to
you
at
London

Tomorrow
I
intend
for
Woodstock
and
from
thence
to
London
where
I
hope
to
receive
your
commands

Gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
I
forgot
by
reason
of
my
haste
to
give
you
account
(
what
doubtless
you
have
known
from
other
hands
that
Sir
Robert
Sawyer
having
written
a
letter
to
Mr.
Golsbrough
clerk
of
the
Commons
to
be
read
signifying
that
he
was
by
sickness
disabled
from
performing
his
place
and
Mr.
Secretary
Williamson
informing
the
House
that
his
Majesty
gave
them
leave
to
choose
a
new
speaker
Mr.
Seymor
was
upon
Monday
last
chosen
Speaker
and
approved
at
the
Lords
bar
by
his
Majesty
in
the
usual
manner

I
am
gentlemen
etc.
Your
most
affectionate
servant
Andrew
Marvell
There
was
no
counsell
yesterday

And
how
they
will
dispose
now
of
that
is
uncertain
for
it
being
late
the
House
Adjourned
without
coming
to
any
further
Resolution

Then
the
several
paragraphs
of
the
address
were
in
order
put
to
the
question
and
upon
two
of
the
most
material
there
were
two
divisions
of
the
House

Today
a
verbal
message
as
from
the
King
was
delivered
by
secretary
Williamson
that
he
would
receive
their
address
in
the
afternoon
and
to
enter
immediately
into
consideration
of
a
supply

Also
this
prorogation
having
thus
happened
and
if
there
should
be
a
peace
it
is
now
in
the
King
and
parliament’s
power
to
revoke
the
French
prohibition
next
meeting

The
Lords
have
also
ordered
the
speech
to
be
printed
so
that
I
suppose
one
way
or
other
I
may
by
the
next
post
compose
it
for
you

Also
a
committee
to
inspect
the
laws
concerning
the
poor
in
order
to
rectify
them

They
then
received
the
report
of
the
accounts
of
the
200000
pounds
taken
upon
the
clause
for
credit
upon
the
excise
and
voted
first
upon
a
division
of
139
to
131

Then
that
they
would
not
consider
of
any
compensation
for
the
French
Prohibition
the
revenue
not
having
as
yet
suffered
by
it

In
the
copy
of
the
late
conference
where
it
speaks
that
the
states
should
have
taken
so
much
pains
in
vain
etc.
the
word
business
ought
to

I
remain

affectionate

He
is
a
fair
conditioned
gentleman
and
has
a
pretty
good
estate
and
not
unlikely
to
be
ungrateful
wherefore
be
careful
of
him
and
kind
unto
him
and
render
to
answer
his
doubts
and
not
to
discourage
him

Mr.
Soames
may
be
recalled
from
Turin
since
the
prince
is
dealing
with
the
French
about
it

Examine
therefore
the
pectoral
parts
and
endeavour
to
find
out
the
ground
of
such
an
opinion
at
opportunity

If
the
profits
of
the
next
year
come
not
up
to
this
I
would
not
have
you
discouraged
for
the
profits
of
no
practise
are
equal
or
regular
and
you
have
had
some
extraordinary
patients
this
year
which
perhaps
some
years
will
not
afford

We
hear
of
2
ostriches
which
are
brought
from
Tanger

Mrs.
Dey
is
at
my
house
but
returns
with
Madame
Burwell

I
thought
to
have
sent
a
spider
by
him
which
was
brought
me
out
of
the
fields
large
and
round
and
finely
marked
green
and
even
almost
as
big
as
the
figures
enclosed
drawn
by
your
mother
for
your
sisters
dared
not
do
it
it
may
be
seen
in
Moufetus
and
I
have
had
of
them
before
and
one
drawn
out
in
oiled
colours
upon
an
oiled
paper

Dear
Son
My
cousin
Cradock
went
suddenly
away
so
that
I
could
not
enjoy
him
at
my
house
as
I
intended
present
my
service
unto
him
and
my
cousin
his
wife

But
when
this
parcel
is
spent
a
great
doubt
there
will
be
how
any
more
will
be
acquired
and
'it is
not
very
likely
that
there
is
any
true
way
delivered
in
the
book
to
make
a
new
powder
so
that
its
probable
this
parcel
will
be
soon
consumed
and
many
great
persons
who
can
be
at
the
charge
will
not
be
without
it

T.B

I
have
not
as
yet
seen
it

We
all
send
our
love
&
good
wishes

I
am
too
well
assured
of
your
Ladyship’s
kindness
to
doubt
the
part
you
take
in
this
loss
you
have
ever
showed
yourself
a
friend
in
so
many
instances
that
I
presume
upon
your
compassion
nothing
but
this
just
occasion
could
have
hindered
me
from
wellcoming
you
to
town
and
rejoicing
with
the
best
friend
I
have
in
the
world
a
friend
by
merit
and
inclination
one
I
must
esteem
as
the
wife
of
so
worthy
a
relation
and
so
sincere
a
friend
as
Sir
Sam
(
Tuke
was
to
me
and
mine

Sir
I
must
confess
I
am
extremely
pleased
I
have
done
you
any
service
in
reference
to
your
children

It
is
well
if
being
writ
(
as
it
has
been
by
scraps
at
distant
times
and
places
it
will
hold
together
and
be
of
a
piece

For
when
we
have
all
done
the
right
improvement
and
exercise
of
that
faculty
is
the
highest
perfection
of
a
man
and
furnishes
all
the
true
light
which
our
minds
can
attain
unto

In
this
choice
be
as
curious
as
you
would
be
in
that
of
a
wife
for
him

As
to
your
Carolina
affair
I
remember
the
owner
told
me
it
was
a
Landgraveship
of
fortyeight
thousand
acres
of
land
and
the
privileges
thereunto
belonging
which
are
to
be
seen
in
the
fundamental
constitutions

I
am
glad
to
hear
my
Lady
King's
son
thrives
so
very
well
but
the
Lady
I
meant
is
a
relation
of
the
Lady
that
did
me
the
honour
to
remember
to
me
in
your
last

31st
Oct

I
suppose
without
the
help
of
instances
in
your
view
you
know
of
what
value
a
trusty
servant
is

But
to
return
to
the
abele
trees
pray
what
do
you
mean
by
so
great
a
number
of
them

We
had
some
pleasant
scenes
here
which
would
come
into
the
history
of
my
travels
if
I
were
with
you
to
tell
them

Pray
present
my
humble
service
to
Madam

Sir
You
have
here
at
length
the
fourth
and
last
book
of
my
scattered
thoughts
concerning
the
understanding
and
I
see
now
more
than
ever
that
I
have
reason
to
call
them
scattered
since
never
having
looked
them
over
all
together
till
since
this
last
part
was
done
I
find
the
ill
effects
of
writing
in
patches
and
at
distant
times
as
this
whole
essay
has
been

31st
December
1686

And
I
would
by
him
also
have
sent
to
you
a
grant
of
your
estate
at
Beluton
and
St.
Thomas
to
J.
N

For
Mr.
John
Locke
these

But
notwithstanding
these
and
many
other
unexpected
misfortunes
that
have
happened
yet
Madam
and
I
are
not
totally
without
hopes
of
seeing
you
before
we
return
into
the
West
if
there
be
a
possibility
of
my
getting
so
much
time
as
to
come
to
you
which
I
most
earnestly
and
heartily
wish
for

But
by
his
discourse
I
have
reason
to
doubt
that
matter
was
not
managed
exactly
pursuant
to
the
method
directed
by
you
but
all
being
over
before
my
return
to
town
I
was
thereby
altogether
disabled
from
serving
you
in
that
affair
as
otherwise
I
should
have
done

I
thank
God
I
am
now
able
to
tell
you
that
I
am
at
present
free
from
both
and
do
hope
shall
continue
so
but
am
not
in
condition
to
go
abroad
to
dispatch
the
business
I
came
into
the
country
for
which
you
may
imagine
(
my
circumstances
considered
is
no
small
disappointment
and
trouble
to
me

Miss
Betty
adds
her
service
to
you
and
all
her
younger
gallants
etc.

The
Duke
of
Somerset
says
he
never
remembers
seeing
him
better

My
head
and
heart
is
too
full
to
be
able
to
express
what
I
feel
for
you
and
my
self
upon
this
great
blow
to
our
family
yet
I
cannot
let
this
messenger
return
without
assuring
you
that
you
have
no
friend
bears
a
greater
share
with
you
which
I
am
doubly
concerned
in
both
for
your
sake
and
my
own

My
Lord
presents
his
humble
service
to
your
Ladyship
and
bids
me
tell
you
he
shall
think
it
a
good
fortune
if
he
be
capable
in
any
kind
to
serve
you

Also
if
any
man
by
cause
of
service
or
other
leeful
commandment
approached
a
lord
to
which
lord
he
Nichol
dread
his
falsehood
to
be
known
to
anon
was
impeached
that
he
was
false
to
the
council
of
the
city
and
so
to
the
King

For
that
gracious
lords
like
it
to
you
to
take
heed
in
what
manner
and
where
our
liege
lord's
power
has
been
misused
by
the
foresaid
Nichol
and
his
upbearers
for
since
these
wrongs
before
said
have
been
used
as
accidental
or
commune
branches
outward
it
shows
well
the
route
of
him
is
a
ragged
subject
or
stock
inward
that
is
the
foresaid
Brere

which
common

and
many
other

you
may
be
shown

known

an

which
with
your
rightful
lordship
granted
for
most
principal
remedy
as
God's

all

We
greet
you
often
times
well
doing
you
to
understand
for
your
comfort
that
by
the
grace
of
God
we
are
safely
arrived
into
our
land
of
Normandy
with
all
our
subjects
ordained
to
go
with
us
for
the
first
passage
and
this
day
the
even
of
Saint
Laurence
about
midday
was
yielded
unto
us
the
Castle
of
Touque
about
the
which
our
wellbeloved
cousin
the Earl
of
Huntingdon
lay
and
the
keys
of
the
said
castle
delivered
unto
us
without
shedding
of
Christian
blood
or
defense
made
by
our
enemies
the
which
castle
is
an
honour
and
all
the
viscounts
and
Lordships
of
Auge
held
thereof
as
we
been
informed
by
such
men
as
were
there
in

And
after
that
we
had
won
our
said
town
of
Louiers
we
came
afore
Pont-de-Larche
and
besieged
it
on
that
one
side
of
the
river
of
Seine
and
upon
Monday
the
4
day
of
the
month
of
July
we
got
upon
our
enemies
the
passage
over
the
said
river
and
God
of
his
mercy
showed
so
for
us
and
for
our
right
that
it
was
without
the
death
of
any
person
of
ours
albeit
that
our
enemies
with
great
power
assembled
nigh
the
same
river
for
to
have
let
and
defended
us
the
same
passage

This

God

that
you

by

it

is

as

seems
to
besiege

Most

Sovereign

we

at

the

declaring

Furthermore
as
touching
the
going
of
the
said
John
Shillingford
mayor
he
was
all
ready
for
to
ride
the
said
Monday
varians
I
moved
between
him
and
the
said
Richard
Druell
nevertheless
better
accord
had
by
means
of
Thomas
Cook
Richard
Druell
with
others
held
his
way
and
the
said
mayor
abode
at
home
in
to
a
Tuesday
next
after
Saint
Luke's
day
for
setting
of
the
King's
dime
coming
of
Trevylian
and
other
great
matters
touching
the
city
and
in
especial
to
have
the
fellowship
together
a
sad
communication
to
be
had
or
his
departing
the
which
communication
might
not
be
had
before
Saturday
next
after
Saint
Luke's
day
for
this
cause
that
the
great
part
of
the
fellowship
was
at
Calston's
fair
and
those
that
were
at
home
as
Upton
Coteler
and
Pope
were
sick
on
their
beds
and
for
all
these
causes
the
mayor
abode
at
home
so
long
and
all
that
time
he
kept
his
3
horses
in
stable
every
day
ready
to
ride
to
him
great
coste

And
with
right
good
language
and
good
cheer
in
goodly
wise
excused
him
that
he
might
not
speak
with
us
at
that
time
for
great
business
and
commanded
us
to
come
again
tomorrow

And
as
I
conceive
by
diverse
words
that
they
have
commoned
of
a
rule
in
this
matter
what
ever
it
is
I
can
not
know
as
yet

Nota
that
Druell
and
Speere's
being
afore
ahead
did
good
for
they
did
their
part
in
the
most
best
wise

Geoffrey
asked
Palmer
why
the
rent
was
not
asked
in
my
husband's
time
and
Palmer
said
for
he
was
a
great
man
and
a
wise
man
of
the
law
and
that
was
the
cause
men
would
not
ask
him
the
rent

And
as
for
the
demission
made
to
the
abbot
of
Melrosse
of
certain
tends
I
will
the
said
dimission
be
kept
to
him
like
as
the
writing
purports
and
openly
shows

God
give
grace
that
the
sea
may
be
better
kept
than
it
is
now
or
else
it
shall
ben
a
perilous
dwelling
by
the
sea
cost

By
your
mother
Agnes
Paston

Also
he
said
that
it
was
well
done
that
I
set
men
to
work
to
owl
money
while
I
was
here
but
in
the
end
I
shall
lessen
my
cost

Like it
you
to
know
that
right
late
I
received
your
gentle
letter
and
writing
wherein
I
conceive
and
know
perfectly
your
good
heart
and
tender

Tuesday

Annis’
day

in
haste
the
Monday
next
after
Palm
Sunday

Item
it
is
told
me
that
Thomas
Elys
of
Norwych
which
now
is
chosen
mayor
said
at
Drayton
that
if
my
Lord
of
Suffolk
need
a
100
men
he
would
purvey
him
thereof
and
if
any
men
of
the
town
would
go
to
Paston
he
would
do
lay
them
fast
in
prison
Item
I
have
left
John
Paston
the
older
at
Caster
to
keep
the
place
there
as
Richard
can
tell
you
for
I
had
lief
and
it
pleased
you
to
be
captainess
here
than

Caster

Address
To
my
right
worshipful
husband
John
Paston
in
haste

I
suppose
if
they
might
have
come
in
peaceably
they
would
have
made
another
cause
of
their
coming

And
he
broke
them
and
Richard
has
the
copies
of
them
and
he
said
he
would
send
the
writs
to
his
undersheriff
and
a
letter
therewith
charging
him
that
he
should
do
therein
as
largely
as
he
ought
to
do

ON
Tuesday
in
the
morning
was
John
Botiller
otherwise
called
John
Palmer
and
Davy
Arnald
your
cook
and
William
Malthows
of
Aylsham
taken
at
Heylesdon
by
the
bailiff
of
Ey
called
Bottisforth
and
led
for
to
Cossey
and
there
they
keep
them
yet
without
any
warrant
or
authority
of
justice
of
peace

The
log
and
the
remnant
of
your
place
was
beaten
down
on
Tuesday
and
Wednesday
and
the
Duke
rode
on
Wednesday
to
Drayton
and
so
for
to
Cossey
while
the
log
at
Heylesdon
was
in
the
beating
down

There
comes
much
people
daily
to
wonder
thereupon
both
of
Norwich
and
of
other
places
and
they
speak
shamefully
thereof

And
also
the
Mayor
would
have
had
them
sworn
that
they
should
never
be
against
the
Duke
nor
none
of
his
which
they
would
not
do
in
no
wise
At
the
reverence
of
God
if
any
worshipful
and
profitable
means
may
be
taken
in
your
matters
forsake
it
not
in
eschewing
of
our
trouble
not
great
costs
and
charges
that
we
have
and
may
grow
hereafter

And
there
I
associated
me
with
a
chaplain
of
my
Lord
the
Archbishop
of
York
and
a
merchant
of
London
and
departed
not
till
we
came
to
Rome
thanked
be
God
avoided
all
apparel
not
withstanding
the
great
wars
that
were
in
every
country
we
passed
through

There
comes
a
man
to
you
called
Mr.
John
Norham
notary
papal
and
imperial
the
which
testified
of
expulsion
of
the
Prior
of
Coldyngham
and
the
intrusion
of
M.
Patrik
and
Jon
Hume

By
your
own
Jane
Stonor

Also
me
thinks
they
should
not
be
so
weary
of
you
that
did
so
great
labour
and
diligence
to
have
you
and
whereas
you
think
I
should
be
unkind
to
you
verily
that
am
I
not
for
and
you
be
as
I
left
you
as
I
trust
verily
that
you
be
I
am
and
will
be
to
you
as
a
mother
should
be
and
if
so
be
they
be
weary
of
you
you
shall
come
to
me
and
you
will
yourself
so
that
my
husband
or
I
may
have
writing
from
the
queen
with
her
own
hand
and
else
he
nor
I
neither
dare
nor
will
take
upon
us
to
receive
you
seeing
the
queen’s
displeasure
afore
for
my
husband
says
he
has
not
willingly
disobeyed
her
commandment
here
afore
nor
he
will
not
begin
now

And
for
so
much
as
for
shortness
of
time
he
might
not
utter
till
his
holiness
his
intent
at
that
time
he
besought
his
holiness
to
continue
the
said
commission
till
the
next
Consistory
and
the
coming
of
the
King
of
France
ambassadors
the
which
shall
enter
Rome
the
Saturday
next
after
the
day
afore
rehearsed
whereupon
the
Pope
was
right
well
content
and
so
decreed

I
beseech
your
good
fatherhood
to
exhort
our
brothers
to
pray
heartily
for
the
cause
of
Coldyngham
the
which
was
proposed
in
Consistorio
publico
at
coming
of
ambassadors
of
the
king
of
Portugal
and
for
shortness
of
time
the
Pope
continued
it
to
the
next
consistory
where
shall
do
their
obedience
the
ambassadors
of
the
king
of
France
and
your
rights
utterly
decided

London

Anno

I
would
have
it
here
against
my
husband's
enterment
and
it
can
not
come
better
at
no
time
than
with
you
now
because
of
strength

For
in
truth
I
had
well
hoped
that
your
horses
should
have
been
here
at
this
night
and
that
I
thought
verily
and
so
pointed
my
self
for
to
a
be
with
you
as
the
morrow
at
night
with
God's
mercy
which
should
have
ben
to
me
right
a
great
comfort
for
in
good
faith
I
have
not
been
merry
at
my
heart
this
sevennight
day
for
diverse
matters
the
which
has
been
broken

Stonor
from

desiring
you
to
say
to

I
marvel
greatly
what
moves
him
to
say
such
language
by
me
as
he
does
for
as
that
I
would
pluck
from
your
livelihood
all

can
to
make
a
great
for
that
I
wit
well
you

well
enough

Furthermore

your

As

shortly
-
I
pray
you
keep

God's

By
the
Queen

I
was
in
good
health
thinking
long
sith
I
saw
you
and
if
I
had
known
that
I
should
have
been
this
long
time
from
you
I
would
have
be
much
loather
than
I
was
to
have
come
into
this
far
country

And
whereas
we
furthermore
understand
that

us
or
our
council
your
said
commission
if
any
such
you
have

Sir
it
will
be
a
shrewd
loss
to
receive

Nemyng
groats

5
pence
and
pay
it
into
the
place
at
4
pence

His
attorney
is
a
wrangling
fellow

Groty's
etc.

I

and
of
your

blessed
be
Jesus
with
all
your
servants

And
therefore
if
you
can
find
any
remedy
I
pray
you
for
and
also
I
pray
you
to
send
me
some
word
as
soon
as
you
may
of
your
good
speed

And
Sir
I
pray
you
that
you
be
not
miscontent
that
I
sent
not
to
you
for
indeed
I
make
the
labour
that
is
possible
for
me
to
make
and
as
yet
I
cannot
speed
but
as
shortly
as
I
can
I
shall
speed
the
matter

Sir
it
is
so
that
my
Lord
Archbishop
has
indicted
my
son
William
and
16
of
his
servants
on
Tuesday
was
a
senate

Cousin
Thomas
Everyngham
I
recommend
me
unto
you
thanking
you
of
your
good
mind
and
will
at
all
times
praying
you
that
you
will
take
the
labour
and
pain
upon
you
to
come
and
speak
with
me
between
this
and
Tuesday
next
as
my
special
trust
is
in
you
and
that
you
fail
not
thereof
as
I
may
do
for
you
as
much
in
time
to
come

Then
after
many
matters
spoken
by
my
master
your
deputy
and
reasoned
to
the
same
by
your
treasurer
and
porter
which
matters
and
whereof
they
were
I
am
and
shall be
ready
to
show
to
your
Highness
at
such
time
or
times
that
best
shall
please
your
grace
that
I
so
do

Item
after
many
words
spoken
Sir
Hugh
Conway
said
"
Masters
I
have not
spoken
these
words
for
no
untruth
that
I
do
think
by
now
in
my
Lord
Chamberlain
for
I
dare
say
now
as
you
do
that
he
loves
the
King
as well
as
any
man
can do
living
but
it
has
been
seen
in
times
past
that
change
of
worlds
has
caused
change
of
mind

You
have
in
mind
what
that
I
have
showed
you
touching
this
matters

I
prayed
his
Highness
to
pardon
me
for
I
said
that
I
was
sworn
to
him
that
I
should
never
utter
him
to
be
drawn
with
wild
horses
wherewith
the
King
was
angry
and
displeased
with
me
for
my
good
will

And
for
truth
I
know well
that
he
cannot
long
continue
for
it
is
written
of
him
that
he
shall
no
longer
reign
than
did
King
Edward
which"

Remember
well
how
near
that
Kent
is
hither
what
alliance
they
be
of
there

And
we
do
wisely
I
doubt not
but
by
good
counsel
we
shall be
able
by
good
police
to
destroy
all
the
captains
and
ringleaders
that
be
of
ill
and
contrary
mind
that
done
the
other
will be
good
to
rule

And
also
I
pray
you
to
send
me
word
how
you
speed
in
your
matters
again
as
soon
as
you
may
and
also
to
send
me
word
where
you
will
your
horses
to
come
to
you

And
so
they
have
taken
Edmund
Ward
at
Knarsbrough
and
arrest
him
the
which
is
a
great
nossen
in
the
country
that
they
shall
get
such
process
and
you
do
none
to
them
but
let
them
have
their
mind
fulfilled
in
every
case

From
Plompton
in
haste
the
12th
day
of
April

(
13
April
1504

Dame
AGNES
PLOMPTON

For
God’s
sake
Sir
hold
me
excused
that
I
write
not
my
self
to
your
Grace
for
I
have
no
liefer
this
time
but
with
a
wish
I
would
I
were
with
your
Grace
now
and
many
times
more
when
I
would
answer

Moreover
as
touching
the
custody
of
all
such
evidence
as
I
have
now
in
my
keeping
concerning
the inheritance
of
my
sad
son
Germane
a
gentleman
of
your
acquaintance
Mr.
Harry
Arden
has
been
in
hand
with
me
for
them
and
I
have
showed
him
whensoever
and
to
whom
it
shall be
thought
by
you
most
convenient
time
of
the
deliverance
of
them
I
will be
ready
to
deliver
them
for
I
will
be
glad
to
be
discharged
of
them
for
I
will
flit
at
this
next
Michaelmas
as
I
am
fully
minded
or
sooner
with
God’s
grace

And
my
Dame
not
only
in
this
but
in
all
other
things
that
I
may
know
should
be
to
your
honour
and
pleasure
and
weal
of
your
soul
I
shall
be
as
glad
to
please
you
as
your
heart
can
desire
it
and
I
know
well
that
I
am
as
much
bound
so
to
do
as
any
creature
living
for
the
great
and
singular
motherly
love
and
affection
that
it
has
pleased
you
at
all
times
to
bear
towards
me

Madame
I
have
encumbered
you
now
with
this
my
long
writings
but
me
thinks
that
I
can
do
no
less
considering
that
it
is
so
seldom
that
I
do
write
wherefore
I
beseech
you
to
pardon
me
for
verily
Madame
my
sight
is
nothing
so
perfect
as
it
has
been
and
I
know
well
it
will
displeases
though
I
write
not
so
often
with
mine
own
hand
for
on
my
faith
I
have
been
three
days
or
I
could
make
an
end
of
this
letter

But
if
we
will
sell
it
send
word
to
your
son
what
you
will
do
for
I
know
nothing
else
to
help
you
with

And
write
to
my
lady
thanking
her
good
ladyship
of
her
so
loving
and
tender
kindness
showed
unto
me
beseeching
her
ladyship
of
good
continuance
thereof

And
if
it
so
may
please
your
Grace
I
humbly
beseech
the
same
to
give
further
credence
also
to
this
bearer

To
my
good
Lady
Dame
Anne
Rokesby
be
this
delivered

God
reward
her
which
I
am
much
bound
unto

We
are
ashamed
therewith
and
would
God
never
word
had
been
thereof

The emperor
has
done
every
thing
like
himself

I
thought
to
send
himself
unto
you
but
our
Englishmen’s
hearts
would
not
suffer
it

Now
since
that
time
came
a
post
from
my
lord
Howard
with
a
writing
at
length
of
every
thing
as
it
was
which
I
now
send
to
the
King
and
you
shall
thereby
perceive
so
great
a
gift
that
almighty
God
has
sent
to
the
King
for
to
me
it
is
thought
the
greatest
honour
that
ever
prince
had
his
subjects
in
his
absence
not
only
to
have
the
victory
but
also
to
slay
the
King
and
many
of
his
noblemen

Master
Almoner
I
cannot
send
you
now
my
lord
of
Canterbury’s
answer
for
the
coffer
wherein
it
is
is
gone
to
my
next
lodging
and
therefore
I
shall
this
night
send
it
you
by
post

Pleases
it
your
grace
to
understand
that
my
Lord
the
King
has
instantly
desired
me
to
write
unto
you
that
it
would
please
you
for
his
sake
and
mine
to
send
unto
my
Lord
Darcy
to
deliver
Francois
Descars
upon
a
reasonable
ransom
unto
you
and
that
it
would
please
your
grace
to
pay
his
ransom
for
the
time
and
that
he
might
be
delivered
unto
your
grace
you
shortly
to
have
the
money
again
after
that
word
is
of
his
deliverance
or
else
he
not
to
return
as
hither

And
if
it
may
be
by
any
mean
possible
I
humbly
require
you
to
cause
my
said
mother
Guldford
to
repair
hither
once
again

I
have
not
yet
seen
in
France
any
lady
or
gentle
woman
so
necessary
for
me
as
she
is
nor
yet
so
meet
to
do
the
King
my
brother
service
as
she
is

And
thus
I
beseech
our
Lord
to
send
unto
you
my
most
dearest
and
entirely
belove
brother
and
Lord
long
and
prosperous
life
with
the
full
accomplishment
of
al
your
honourable
desires
most
humbly
praying
your
Grace
that
I
may
be
humbly
recommended
unto
my
most
dearest
and
best
beloved
sister
the
Queen
Grace
and
to
the
Queene
of
Scots
my
wellbeloved
sister
trusting
that
she
be
ascertained
from
your
Grace
of
the
prosperous
estate
and
health
of
my
everly
beloved
nephews
the
princes
to
whom
I
pray
God
send
long
life

To
the
King
my
brother

To
the
king's
grace
my
brother
this
be
delivered

By
your
loving
friend
MARY
QUEEN
OF
FRANCE

You
write
to
me
that
such
persons
as
he
sent
for
my
matters
in
to
Scotland
trust
to
be
well
answered
and
has
sent
to
me
such
writings
as
they
sent
to
him

My
lord
for as much
as
I
see
you
benevolent
unto
me
in
all
my
matters
and
ever
has
been
since
our
first
acquaintance
and
now
especially
I
pray
you
therefore
to
do
so
much
at
mine
instance
and
request
to
desire
your
chaplain
to
resign
the
said
prebend
to
the
behalf
and
use
of
my
said
almoner
and
I
promise
you
that
I
will
not
cease
unto
(
until
I
have
gotten
some
promotion
of
the
king
my
brother
or
else
of
some
other
person
for
your
said
chaplain
which
I
trust
shall
be
worth
double
the
value
of
Saint
Stephen's
and
besides
that
I
shall
help
that
he
may
have
the
next
prebend
hereafter
in
Saint
Stephen's

My
lord
I
require
you
that
I
may
have
so
comfortable
letters
from
the
king
my
brother
and
from
you
for
I
throw
there
was
never
woman
that
had
more
need

And
now
that
your
grace
knows
the
both
offences
of
the
which
I
have
been
the
only
occasion
I
most
humbly
and
as
your
most
sorrowful
sister
requiring
you
to
have
compassion
upon
us
both
and
to
pardon
our
offences
and
that
it
will
please
your
grace
to
write
to
me
and
to
my
lord
of
Suffolk
some
comfortable
words
for
it
should
be
greatest
comfort
for
us
both

Heartily
praying
you
and
trusting
that
you
will
do
it
with
effect
and
to
rescribe
unto
me
your
good
will
done
therein

My
Lord
Cardinal
I
recommend
me
to
you
and
I
would
fain
have
spoken
with
you
but
you
were
gone
ere
I
could
come
to
you
and
therefore
I
must
write
to
you
my
mind

Cromwell
I
will
that
you
send
to
me
in
haste
the
trussing
bed
of
cloth
of
tissue
and
the
feather
bed
with
the
fustions
and
a
mattress
belonging
to
the
same
with
the
counterpoint
also
I
will
that
you
deliver
all
such
tents
pavilions
and
halls
as
you
have
of
mine
on
to
my
son
Lenard
as
you
tender
my
pleasure

My
lord
Cardinal
has
promised
on
his
faith
that
the
2
shillings
of
the
pound
of
lone
money
shall be
payed
with
a
good
will
and
with
thank

And
I
think
now
that
this
money
is
granted
so
shall
it
be
with
us

And
so
shall
it
be
the
longer
ere
he
shall
incline
to
any
reasonable
conditions
of
peace

For
his
Grace
never
saw
him
before
but
he
understands
now
that
before
this
time
he
was
in
England
when
the Emperor
was
here
and
slew
a
man
and
escaped
his
way

Who
has
in
the
reading
thereof
substantially
considered
as
well
the
Queen
his
sisters
letter
with
the
letters
againward
devised
and
sent
by
my
Lord
Admiral
to
her
and
his
letters
of
advertisement
to
your
Grace
as
your
most
political
devices
and
answers
unto
all
the
same
among
which
the
letter
which
your
Grace
devised
in
the
name
of
his
Highness
to
the
Queen
his
sister
his
Grace
so
well
liked
that
I
never
saw
him
like
thing
better
and
as
help
me
God
in
my
poor
fantasy
not
causeless
for
it
is
for
the
quantity
one
of
the
best
made
letters
for
words
matter
sentence
and
couching
that
ever
I
read
in
my
life

At
Okyng
the
first
day
of
September

Anne
the
Queen

And
both
my
prayer
and
service
shall
help
to
this
during
my
natural
life
as
most
bound
so
to
do
God
my
witness
who
evermore
preserve
you

Albeit
as well
for
the
ordering
of
matters
between
us
and
France
as
for
the
assurance
of
the
King’s
pension
with
other
things
that
I
shall
reasonably
lay
in
the
way
I
did
not
so
to
entreat
the
articles
of
this
new
treaty
that
the
time
of
doing
any
thing
this
year
shall be
well
passed
or
any
conclusion
may
be
taken
therein
in
the
same

I
trust
the
faction
of
them
shall
please
the
King’s
Highness

I
beseech
you
of
your
goodness
for
your
accustomed
goodness
to
continue
until
such
time
that
I
may
once
tread
under
foot
this
horrible
monster
poverty
which
hitherto
has
been
so
homely
with
me
that
she
has
made
me
ashamed
of
my
self
and
many
a
hundred
times
to
forbear
to
do
my
duty
to
you
by
cause
I
was
loath
to
cum
to
your
house
with
empty
hands

At
Chelsey
Anno
1533
March

But
she
says
she
trusts
this
term
to
be
dispatched

Of
all
my
dealinge
with
the
Nun
whether
any
other
man
may
peradventure
put
any
doubt
or
move
any
scruple
of
any
other
meaning
than
I
had
that
can
I
neither
tell
nor
lies
in
my
hand
to
let
but
unto
my
self
it
is
not
possible
any
part
of
my
demeanour
to
seem
evil
And
this
the
clearness
of
my
conscience
testifying
that
in
that
matter
my
mind
intent
and
proceeding
was
lawful
and
good

Whereupon
I
went
out
with
him
into
the
gallery
where
his
mastership
sat
with
master
Attorney
*
master
Solicitor
and
diverse
others

And
he
added
that
the
King
was
a
Prince
not
of
rigour
but
of
mercy
and
pity
and
though
he
had
found
obstinacy
in
any
of
his
Subjects
at
some
time
yet
if
they
submitted
themselves
his
Grace
would
show
mercy

And
if
this
be
not
enough
to
keep
me
alive
in
good
faith
I
desire
not
to
live

When
it
shall be
your
pleasure
to
repair
hither
you
must
take
some
pay
to
come
early
in
the
morning
that
you
may
be
gone
again
by
seven
o'clock
and
so
I
suppose
you
may
come
without
suspect

And
now
Sir
to
the
intent
that
you
may
somewhat
perceive
such
poor
qualities
as
be
in
me
and
so
thereupon
with
your
benevolent
mind
you
may
set
forward
somewhat
better
my
purpose
I
shall
bravely
show
unto
you
the
order
process
and
end
of
all
my
studies

Sir
I
was
but
late
by
the
singular
gentleness
of
Master
Secretary
whose
goodness
both
toward
me
and
also
to
you
is
so
sunk
in
to
my
breast
that
during
my
life
I
shall
ever
reckon
my
self
next
to
our
prince
above
all
other
most
faithfully
to
him
bound
for
in
the
court
to
the
King’s
service
and
by
his
most
loving
recommendations
so
graciously
of
his
Highness
accepted
and
admitted
that
shortly
after
it
pleased
the
same
to
call
me
to
his
presence
and
there
of
you
of
your
studies
and
of
your
sentence
and
opinion
in
his
grace's
most
weighty
causes
here
late
defined
most
lovingly
many
things
to
demand
to
the
which
I
made
such
answer
as
ever
I
have
judged
convenient
to
be
made
before
the
majesty
of
a
prince
that
is
such
things
as
I
know
manifest
and
true
plainly
to
affirm
and
such
whereof
I
stand
In
doubt
by
conjecture
only
to
rehearse
and
so
your
mind
heart
and
desire
to
do
his
grace
true
and
faithful
service
which
I
know
no
other
wise
than
I
know
mine
own
I
boldly
did
affirm
but
as
touching
your
opinion
in
his
grace’s
late
defined
causes
one
of
the
matrimony
the
other
concerning
the
authority
of
the
pope
for
as
much
as
you
ever
have
used
this
prudent
silence
never
to
disclose
your
sentence
and
mind
but
in
time
and
place
I
could
not
of
your
opinion
any
thing
therein
plainly
affirm
but
yet
this
to
his
Highness
I
said
and
surely
I
thought
that
as
far
as
your
learning
and
judgement
which
I
esteemed
by
time
and
diligent
study
somewhat
was
altered
and
increased
also
touching
the
discerning
between
God’s
law
and
man’s
would
stretch
and
extend
all
your
power
and
all
such
knowledge
and
learning
as
by
the
goodness
of
God
and
his
grace’s
liberality
you
had
obtained
and
got
to
the
maintaining
of
such
things
as
his
grace’s
wisdom
by
court
of
parliament
therein
had
decreed
you
would
gladly
confer
to
the
honour
of
his
Highness
and
wealth
of
his
realm

For
of
this
doubt
you
nothing
that
albeit
upon
many
reasonable
and
just
causes
our
most
noble
prince
has
withdrawn
himself
from
the
pope's
authority
yet
from
the
certain
and
sure
grounds
of
scripture
his
grace
in
no
point
is
slid
no
nor
yet
from
the
laws
nor
ceremonies
of
the
church
the
which
yet
stand
in
full
strength
and
authority
and
so
they
shall
boldly
I
dare
affirm
until
such
time
that
to
his
Highness
and
to
his
most
wise
conseil
it
shall
appear
expedient
them
to
abrogate
and
other
to
substitute
by
common
assent
more
agreeable
to
this
time
and
to
the
nature
of
our
men
and
also
to
our
whole
country
more
convenient

In
this
and
the
rest
also
though
the
King’s
pleasure
be
you
should
give
place
to
no
man’s
persuasion
nor
authority
as
I
am
sure
you
will
not
yet
for
the
love
that
I
bear
unto
you
and
for
the
desire
that
I
have
that
you
should
see
the
judged
truth
I
will
note
certain
places
of
weight
after
mine
opinion
in
these
things
to
be
considered
ever
leaving
your
own
judgement
free

In
the
acts
of
the
apostles
you
shall
find
no
such
thing
and
after
the
apostles’
days
the
4
patriarchs
of
Jerusalem
of
Antioch
of
Constantinople
of
Rome
had
among
them
no
superiority

After
humbly
salutation
according
to
my
duty
co-acted
I
am
(
causes
considered
to
give
to
you
notice
of
certain
sinistral
matters
contrary
to
our
realm
of
England
specially
against
our
most
armipotent
perpondent
circumspect
discrete
and
gracious
sovereign
Lord
the
King
for
since
my
departing
from
you
I
have
perlustrated
Normandy
France
Gascony
and
Byon
the
regions
also
of
Castile
Byscay
Spain
part
of
Portugal
and
returned
through
Aragon
Naverne
and
now
am
at
Bordeaux

The
seeds
be
sown
in
March
thin
and
when
they
be
rooted
they
must
be
taken
up
and
set
every
one
of
them
a
foot
or
more
from
another
and
well
watered
etc.

Written
in
haste
in
the
cell
of
the
reverend
father
called
Johan
and
with
his
counsel
the
2nd
day
of
August
by
the
hand
of
your
beadman
Andrew
Bord
priest

I
have
sent
you
a
poor
token
by
my
daughter
Jane
Grenville
apair
of
hosen
of
Garnsy
making
would
to
Jesus
I
had
some
pleasure
to
send
you
as
I
am
bound

After
humbly
salutation
with
due
reverence
I
certify
your
mastership
that
I
am
now
in
Scotland
in
a
little
university
or
study
named
Glasgow
where
I
study
and
practise
physic
as
I
have
done
in
diverse
regions
and
provinces
for
the
sustentation
of
my
living
assuring
you
that
in
the
parts
that
I
am
in
the
King’s
grace
has
many
you
(
and
in
manner
all
manner
of
persons
(
except
some
scholastical
men
that
be
his
adversaries
and
speaks
parleous
words

If
I
might
do
England
any
service
specially
to
my
sovereign
Lord
the
King
and
to
you
I
would
do
it
to
spend
and
put
my
life
in
danger
and
jeopardy
as
far
as
any
man
God
be
my
judge

Reverently
saluted

Boorde
priest

Most
gracious
and
benign
sovereign
Lord
please
it
your
Highness
to
understand
that
we
have
seen
and
been
in
your
new
Great
Ship
and
the
rest
of
your
ships
at
Portsmouth
which
are
things
so
goodly
to
behold
that
in
our
lives
we
have
not
seen
(
excepting
your
royal
person
and
my
lord
the
Prince
your
son
a
more
pleasant
sight
for
which
and
the
most
bountiful
gifts
the
cheer
and
most
gracious
entertainment
which
your
Grace
hath
vouchsaved
to
bestow
upon
us
your
most
unworthy
and
humble
servants
we
render
and
send
unto
the
same
our
most
humble
and
entire
thanks
which
we
beseech
your
Majesty
to
accept
in
good
part
advertising
the
same
that
there
rest
now
but
only
2
sorrows
the
one
for
lack
of
your
royal
presence
that
you
might
have
seen
your
said
ships
now
at
this
time
when
we
might
have
waited
on
you
here
the
other
that
we
think
long
till
it
may
eftsoon
like
you
to
have
us
with
you
which
we
all
most
heartily
beseech
our
Lord
God
may
be
shortly
who
preserve
your
most
noble
person
and
my
Lord
Prince
and
grant
you
both
to
reign
over
us
Your
Majesty
many
years
His
Grace
with
long
continuance
but
by
late
succession
as
never
princes
did
before
you

To
my
very
good
Lord
the
viscount
lisle
deputy
of
the
King’s
Town
and
marches
of
Calais

To
my
very
good
Lord
my
Lord
Sturton
this
be
delivered
After
my
right
hearty
commendations
unto
your
Lordship
whereas
I
am
informed
that
Sir
Richard
Smithe
parson
of
Langom
in
the
county
of
Pembroke
is
accused
and
laid
in
prison
by
the
bailiff
there
for
certain
words
spoken
sounding
to
be
treason
against
the
King’s
majesty

And
therefore
it
is
thought
and
said
that
to
win
a
further
delay
the
King
of
Romaynez
shall
also
go
to
visit
the
French
King
and
by
these
means
shall
the Emperor
thus
win
time
and
take
his
advantage
in
other
parties
having
as
the
King’s
Majesty
is
advised
a
secret
fantasy
in
his
head
that
being
the
French
King
sickly
and
diseased
(
which
is
much
to
the
King’s
Highness
regret
he
devises
how
by
means
to
protract
and
win
looking
for
that
which
his
grace
trusts
he
shall
not
see
and
thinking
if
he
were
once
passed
he
should
easily
enough
frame
all
his
purposes
after
even
as
he
himself
would
wish
and
desire

I
have
been
very
sick
since
you
went
but
I
am
well
now
I
thank
God

All
written
in
my
ship
at
Timmoth

I
think
you
were
never
yet
in
no
ground
of
mine
and
I
never
say
no
man
nay

The
French
men
that
were
of
sea
are
gone
to
Depe
Haven
and
the
English
men
are
of
the
sea
but
the
cold
weather
will
suffer
no
man
long
to
continue
of
the
water

And
if
his
brother
die
without
issue
in
all
by
gift
he
shall
have
5
hundred
mark
land
(
and
if
he
were
but
inheritable
by
the
law
he
should
be
heir
to
him
but
for
default
of
heirship
I
think
he
will
not
change
his
estate
in
this
case
and
for
default
of
heirs
of
my
body
lawfully
begotten
he
shall
inherit
all
that
I
have

And
if
your
sickness
continue
where
the
commandment
comes
forth
send
forth
your
servants
and
tenants
and
send
forth
your
excuse
to
my
Lord
Lieutenant
with
a
letter
of
the
troth
of
your
sickness
and
of
the
time
of
the
continuance
thereof
and
being
advertised
of
the
truth
he
will
except
of
your
lawful
and
reasonable
excuse

Your
assured
friend
to
my
power
Mary
To
my
Cousin
Plumpton
this
be
delivered

I
perceive
your
cocking
varies
from
ours
for
you
lay
but
the
battle
and
if
our
battle
be
but
10
pounds
to
5
pounds
there
will be
10
to
one
lay
or
the
battle
be
ended

assured

From
Hatfield
this
21
of
February

My
Lord
after
my
most
hearty
commendations
because
I
can
not
conveniently
with
my
mouth
render
unto
you
in
presence
those
thanks
for
the
great
goodness
I
find
in
you
daily
that
the
same
does
worthily
deserve
I
thought
it
my
part
of
congruence
at
the
least
by
these
my
rude
letters
to
advertise
you
that
of
my
good
will
and
prayer
to
do
you
stead
or
pleasure
you
shall be
ever
during
my
life
assured
which
I
trust
your
gentleness
will
yet
accept
in
worth
considering
it
is
all
that
I
have
wherewith
I
can
repay
any
part
of
that
charge
and
perfect
friendship
that
I
have
and
do
find
in
you
heartily
requiring
your
continuance
which
besides
the
purchasing
of
my
tedious
suits
wherewith
I
do
ever
molest
you
shall be
my
great
comfort

From
Hatfild
this
present
Saturday

Beseeching
God
long
to
preserve
you
to
his
honour
to
your
comfort
to
the
realm’s
profit
and
to
my
joy

In
deed
they
be
signed
with
your
own
hand
and
nevertheless
in
my
opinion
not
your
Majesty’s
in
effect
because
it
is
well
known
(
as
heretofore
I
have
declared
in
the
presence
of
your
Highness
that
although
Our
Lord
is
praised
your
Majesty
has
far
more
knowledge
and
greater
gifts
than
others
of
your
years
yet
it
is
not
possible
that
your
Highness
can
at
these
years
be
a
judge
in
matters
of
Religion

Also
I
desire
to
have
me
recommended
to
my
sister
Clare
and
to
my
son
Dennis
sending
him
God’s
blessing
and
mine
and
to
all
other
my
kin
and
friends

Wherefore
we
leave
to
proceed
further
therein
being
assured
in
the
goodness
of
God
that
your
hearts
shall be
confirmed
to
owe
your
duty
to
us
your
sovereign
Lady
who
mean
to
preserve
this
Crown
of
England
in
the
royal
blood
and
out
of
the
of
strangers
and
papists
with
the
defense
of
all
you
our
good
subjects
your
lives
lands
and
goods
in
our
peace
against
the
invasions
and
violence
of
all
foreign
or
inward
enemies
and
rebels

Written
in
haste

Yet
because
in
that
case
we
will
be
judged
by
the
laws
of
the
Realm
of
England
we
do
effectuously
require
you
to
have
respect
to
justice
with
indifference
whatsoever
it
shall
please
the
Queen
your
Sovereign
to
put
the
same
matter
in
deliberation

And
therefore
though
we
thought
very
well
of
you
before
yet
shall
we
hereafter
make
a
more
assured
account
of
your
virtues
and
gifts
and
wherein
soever
we
may
conveniently
do
you
pleasure
you
may
be
thereof
assured

But
to
do
as
you
say
if
I
were
culpable
I
would
be
better
advised

Further
it
pleased
you
to
give
license
to
my
subjects
to
go
and
come

No
though
you
would
charge
me
withal

Ye
shall
see
my
bill
which
is
open
it
is
said
Saturday
my
unfriends
will
be
with
you
I
say
nothing
but
trusts
well
and
ye
send
one
to
your
wife
ye
may
assure
her
she
would
have
been
welcome
to
a
poor
stranger
who
not
being
aquainted
with
her
will
not
be
over
bold
to
write
but
for
the
acquaintance
between
us

Right
trusty
and
welbeloved
we
greet
you
well
and
finding
in
the
traitorous
attempts
lately
discovered
that
neither
Barker
nor
Bannister
the
Duke
of
Norfolk’s
men
have
uttered
their
knowledge
neither
will
discover
the
same
without
torture
forasmuch
as
the
knowledge
hereof
concerns
our
surety
and
estate
and
that
they
have
untruly
already
answered
we
will
and
by
warrant
hereof
authorise
you
to
proceed
to
the
further
examination
of
them
upon
all
points
that
you
can
think
by
your
discretions
meet
for
knowledge
of
the
truth

Your
most
loving
Sovereign
ELIZABETH
R.

There
being
nothing
of
which
I
am
so
desirous
(
right
honourable
and
my
singular
good
Lord
and
uncle
as
to
have
continual
and
certain
knowledge
what
your
pleasure
is
by
which
I
may
govern
my
little
actions
I
cannot
be
without
some
grief
that
never
since
I
came
into
Germany
I
could
by
any
means
understand
it

Although
I
have
at
this
present
little
matter
worthy
the
writing
unto
your
Lordship
yet
being
newly
returned
from
my
polish
journey
I
would
not
omit
any
occasion
of
humbly
performing
this
duty

This
I
thought
my
duty
to
write
as
having
heard
it
in
very
good
place
and
much
affected
to
the
true
cause

To
Lord
Burghley
Right
honourable
and
my
singular
good
Lord

He
says
likewise
that
there
came
to
Constantinople
advertisement
that
the
Belierbei
of
Egypt
has
lately
overthrown
In
a
very
great
battle
the
Abissines
subjects

Pretre
John

we
call
him

Your
Lordship’s

our
right
trusty
and
right
welbeloved
Cousin
and
Counsellor
the
Earl
of
Shrewsbury
Earl-Marshall
of
England

if
these
and
the
like
doubts
may
be
of
importance
in
your
seeming
to
frustrate
any part
of
your
advice
I
beseech
you
without
the
least
self
love
of
your
own
purpose
council
me
for
the
best
and
the
rather
do
it
faithfully
and
carefully
for
that
in
all
things
I
attribute
so
much
to
your
judgement
that
I
am
evermore
content
to
annihilate
mine
own
determinations
in
respect
thereof

Such
folly
is
it
not
to
regard
beforehand
the
inclination
and
quality
of
him
to
whom
we
dedicate
our
books

You
shall
see
when
we
meet
in
London
(
which
when
it
shall
be
certify
us
how
fast
I
have
followed
after
you
in
that
course
beware
lest
in
time
I
overtake
you

I
beseech
you
by
all
your
courtesies
and
graces
let
me
be
answered
ere
I
go
which
will
be
(
I
hope
I
fear

think
the
next

I
can
be

I
am
further
to
desire
you
to
further
the
cause
of
my
Chaplin
Bate
on
whom
I
have
bestowed
the

To
conclude
I
beseech
you
pass
no
further
in
this
cause
till
you
receive
an
express
messenger
a
trusty
servant
of
mine
by
whom
you
shall
see
plainly
you
may
receive
honour
and
contentment
with
more
surety
to
your
rest
and
state
than
all
these
dissembling
counsellors
will
or
can
bring
you

I
pray
you
as
ever
you
do
anything
for
me
dispatch
him
with
all
speed
for
else
I
shall be
driven
to
buy
some
of
those
things
here
and
take
up
the
money
upon
interest

I
have
since
and
before
I
came
my
self
to
the
Tower
taken
up
both
armours
and
stele
saddles
as
many
as
must
cost
me
a
good
piece
of
money

For
that
I
know
this
forenoon
some
of
the
estates
will
come
again
to
me
about
this
cause
I
will be
absent
somewhere
till
after
none
by
which
time
I
will
hope
to
receive
further
direction
from
you
which
God
grant
to
be
best
for
her
Majesty’s
own
service
and
her
realm
by
whose
wisdom
and
government
we
are
all
like
either
to
stand
or
fall

Albeit
I
have
no
mistrust
but
in
so
great
absence
and
such
a
service
I
might
greatly
rely
upon
your
particular
good
will
and
regard
of
my
self
but
in
this
case
I
desire
no
respect
nor
regard
of
me
but
of
the
cause
which
I
beseech
you
my
Lord
I
may
at
this
farewell
recommend
to
your
wisdom
and
great
care

I
pray
you
my
Lord
help
us
to
be
kept
in
comfort
for
we
will
hazard
our
lives
for
it

So
they
have
every
day
since
set
about
the
contract
with
her
Majesty
specially
how
to
give
me
answer
for
her
full
satisfaction
touching
there
ability
to
maintain
there
wars
wherein
I
hear
credibly
her
Majesty
shall be
well
satisfied
and
further
then
any
of
us
looked
for

The
King
of
Denmark
also
has
joined
and
encouraged
greatly
these
princes

So
you
will
procure
as
much
as
in
you
may
lye
that
the
most
part
may
be
sent
over

In
much
haste
this
15
of
January
Your
assured
friend
R.
Leicester

And
for
your
part
think
you
have
not
in
the
world
a
more
loving
kinswoman
nor
a
more
dear
friend
than
my
self
nor
any
that
will
watch
more
carefully
to
preserve
you
and
your
estate

Wherefore
I
pray
your
Lordship
that
he
may
be
paid
the
rest
of
his
allowed
warrant
and
that
consideration
for
the
rest
which
I
spoke
to
your
Lordship
for
heretofore

It
was
in
the
Elizabeth
Bonaventure
but
I
hope
to
make
them
a
warning
to
others
to
beware

My
Lord
it
is
a
place
to
be
made
much
of
for
the
haven
has
not
his
fellow
in
all
respects
not
in
this
realm
and
specially
as
long
as
we
have
such
enemies
so
near
us
as
they
be
in
the
Low
Countries
and
not
more
assured
than
we
are
of
Scotland

Upon
your
next
advertisement
as
the
cause
upon
that
shall
require
I
will
write
to
you
Sir
my
good
friend
my
opinion
and
then
you
may
use
it
as
you
shall
think
best

Touching
Sir
Francis
Drake
I
have
likewise
received
a
letter
from
him
with
the
like
advertisement

I
pray
you
Sir
send
me
word
when
you
think
the
Commissioners
will
be
sent
over
that
I
may
have
all
things
ready
for
them
and
I
pray
you
let
me
know
if
any
go
in
Sir
Amyas
Poulet's
place
for
if
he
be
able
to
go
himself
if
I
may
know
of
it
will
have
especial
care
of
him
that
he
may
go
at
ease

If
he
had
been
here
I
would
have
sent
him
unto
you
but
he
is
extreme
sick
at
London
and
as
I
do
understand
in
some
danger
which
I
am
very
sorry
for
for
he
is
a
tall
gentleman

Sir
if
you
think
that
my
continuing
here
with
the
navy
serve
to
good
purpose
I
shall
like
well
of
it
but
methinks
if
there
be
a
surcease
of
arms
then
my
lying
here
will
make
a
jest
to
many
and
they
have
reason

I
will
acknowledge
it
with
all
my
love
and
ready
to
do
you
any
service

the
21st
of
February
at
12
o'clock
the
afternoon

I
have
not
written
this
whereby
your
Majesty
should
diminish
any
of
your
forces

Further
if
they
had
had
none
of
these
former
great
causes
of
distress
yet
the
winds
and
storm
with
the
wind
westerly
as
it
was
has
forced
them
thither

If
they
stay
in
the
sound
this
winter
I
hope
many
of
the
Spaniards
will
seek
Spain
by
land

Since
the
writing
hereof
I
have
spoken
with
an
Englishman
which
came
from
Dunkirk
yesterday
who
says
upon
his
life
there
is
no
fear
of
the
fleet

Right
Honourable
The
uncertainty
of
the
reports
which
daily
come
unto
us
out
of
Calais
Dunkirk
Ostend
Flushing
from
my
Lord
of
Huntingdon
Scotland
and
such
ships
and
pinnaces
which
have
been
sent
out
for
discovery
by
my
Lord
Admiral
make
me
rather
to
rest
upon
mine
own
conjecture
than
upon
any
of
them
they
disagreeing
so
much
as
they
do
the
one
affirming
that
the
Duke
of
Sidonia
with
his
fleet
is
coming
back
again
that
the
Duke
of
Parma
is
marching
presently
to
embark
to
be
conducted
by
him
the
other
affirming
that
it
is
for
certain
that
the
fleet
of
Spain
is
past
without
Scotland
for
their
way
homewards

My
poor
opinion
is
that
the
Duke
of
Parma
should
be
vigilantly
looked
upon
for
these
20
days
although
the
army
of
Spain
return
not
this
way
for
of
them
I
have
no
great
doubt
although
there
be
great
cause
for
us
all
to
watch
carefully
and
defend
mightily
those
many
and
proud
enemies
which
seek
to
supplant
the
most
honourable
crown
of
England
from
our
most
gracious
Sovereign
whom
God
defend
as
he
has
most
graciously
done
for
his
great
mercy's
sake

It
must
be
known
I
have
written
thus
much
to
your
Honour

Why
should
thy
excellent
wit
his
gift
be
so
blinded
that
thou
should
give
no
glory
to
the
giver

Sweet
boy
might
I
advise
the
be
advised
and
get
not
many
enemies
by
bitter
words
inveigh
against
vain

I
received
then
such
noble
courtesies
from
you
as
must
never
be
forgotten
so
be
persuaded

that

pleased

to
the
old

so
bind

reverence

your
virtues
as
I
will
resolve
to
reckon
my
self
a

I
have
yielded
some
demonstrative
testimonies

best
thankfulness

most honest
heart
can
express

the

them

great

I
forbore
to

my
occasions
press
me
so
nearly
that
I
cannot
but
expect
this
reasonable
courtesy

pay
you
half
my
earnings

play

my
continual
labour

only
for
you

if
it
prove
not
profitable

DEAR
LADY
You
should
not
have
had
so
just
cause
to
accuse
me
for
being
thus
long
without
sending
to
you
could
I
have
told
what
certain
account
to
have
given
you
of
my
fortune
which
finding
in
balance
at
my
return
out
of
Rutland
I
still
waited
to
see
which
way
it
would
settle
before
I
write

My
mother
affectionately
salutes
you
and
this
is
all
the
news
this
dull
town
affords
else
by
this
you
may
see
I
should
be
easily
invited
to
lengthen

letter

I
will
conclude

my
best
wishes

DEAR
CORNWALLIS
HAD
I
not
continually
for
a
long
time
expected
your
coming
up
it
had
been
more
needful
for
me
than
you
to
have
excused
so
long
a
silence

In
extreme
haste
with
the
best
affection

LADY
BEDFORD

this
Monday
night

o'clock

DEAR
MADAM
I
THINK
myself
infinitely
beholding
to
you
for
your
kindly
sending
this
bearer
but
indeed
you
do
me
wrong
to
believe
I
should
have
been
gladder
of
anybody's
company
in
my
journey
than
of
yours
and
should
sooner
have
invited
any
of
my
friends
to
have
done
me
that
honour

Of
the
Queen's
court
I
can
say
little
good
for
her
resolution
to
part
with
Roxbrough
still
continues
which
makes
her
look
big
upon
all
she
thinks
loves
that
good
woman
and
they
attend
her
very
seldom
of
which
matter
I
am
one
that
prize
her
favour
but
upon
such
an
occasion
cannot
be
sorry
for
her
frowns
which
are
now
little
to
me
all
my
court
businesses
being
so
dispatched
as
they
will
not
much
require
my
attendance
there
and
I
am
grown
to
love
my
ease
and
liberty
so
well
as
no
measure
of
favour
could
often
invite
me
thither
where
there
is
no
hope
of
any
good
to
be
done

To
my
dear
and
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

My
Lord
Mounteagle
and
Sir
Francis
Goodwinne
affectionately
kiss
your
hands
as
I
do
Mister
Bacon's

To
my
dear
and
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

God
give
me
patience

SWEET
SISTER
Love
does
most
perfectly
shine
when
it
is
steeled
in
adversity

This
month
puts
me
in
mind
to
entreat
the
performance
of
your
promise
for
some
of
the
little
white
single
rose
roots
I
saw
at
Broome
and
to
challenge
Mister
Bacon's
promise
for
some
flowers
if
about
you
there
be
any
extraordinary
ones
for
I
am
now
very
busy
furnishing
my
gardens

From
Venice
this
26th
of
July
1618

9th
of
October
1618

I
should
be
glad
you
would
resolve
to
bring
up
your
children
and
family
because
I
think
it
would
be
best
for
them
and
you
but
if
on
the
sudden
you
cannot
accommodate
yourself
with
a
convenient
house
for
them
all
if
it
please
you
to
let
me
have
your
company
here
while
you
are
providing
yourself
with
a
convenient
dwelling
for
your
whole
company
you
shall
do
me
a
very
great
pleasure
and
though
my
Lord
should
be
in
town
no
whit
straiten
me
for
I
can
well
spare
your
wanted
lodgings

SWEET
LADY
I
DESIRE
much
to
hear
of
your
perfect
recovery
of
health
and
strength
after
your
great
pain
and
God
send
you
much
joy
of
your
last
son
and
no
less
of
your
first

Your
unfortunate
loving
sister
MARY
BATH

It
was
not
my
meaning
when
I
took
this
leaf
to
make
myself
the
subject
of
my
letter
unto
your
Lordship
though
the
remembrance
of
your
ancient
favours
has
I
know
not
how
made
my
pen
so
familiar

I
leave
here
(
as
Sir
Dudley
Carleton
did
during
the
whole
time
of
his
negotiation
in
Piedmont
Gregorio
de'
Monti
to
supply
the
service
by
continual
advertisements
upon
which
point
I
gave
a
touch
at
my
leavetaking
to
the
Prince
desiring
him
to
esteem
it
as
an
argument
of
clear
and
disumbrageous
friendship
that
we
serve
ourselves
even
of
his
own
subjects
for
Gregorio
is
a
natural
Venetian
though
now
many
years
as
it
were
English
with
singular
approvement
both
of
his
fidelity
diligence
and
discretion

Yet
with
this
mercy
to
him
that
he
has
given
him
the
hope
of
another
my
Lady
being
as
we
think
with
child
again

Now
if
you
be
so
cruel
as
you
cannot
forgive
me
this
fault
please
yourself
in
imposing
any
punishment
on
me
you
think
my
offence
deserves
and
I
shall
willingly
undergo
it
so
it
may
purchase
my
pardon
which
I
affectionately
beg
under
promise
never
to
be
a
trespasser
in
this
kind
again

I
can
write
no
longer
company
interrupting
me
therefore
dear
madam
farewell
and
love
still
Your
most
faithful
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

Nor
do
I
fear
finding
this
any
serious
work
for
her
having
a
thing
so
well
known
as
I
have
already
many
offerers
for
it

Sir
Thomas
Fraser
our
old
fellow
is
either
dead
or
cannot
pass
this
night
of
an
imposthume
the
physicians
conclude
in
the
mesentery

Harington
House
this
28th
of
November
1623

Some
account
of
what
passes
here
to
entertain
you
I
will
make
unto
you

The
Houses
have
sit
so
short
a
time
as
what
they
do
is
not
yet
to
be
judged
but
I
trust
things
will
succeed
well
both
for
the
Church
and
the
Commonwealth

I
exercised
more
yesterday
by
walking
than
I
have
these
4
months
and
I
have
very
well
endured
that
(
God
be
thanked
being
at
this
time
every
way
better
and
better

To
my
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

I
know
I
need
not
tell
you
that
I
take
your
kind
sending
as
kindly
as
is
possible
and
that
I
thank
you
more
for
it
than
I
can
set
down

I
intend
God
willing
within
ten
or
twelve
days
at
farthest
to
be
fixed
at
More
Park
from
whence
I
will
send
to
you

Besides
(
which
indeed
is
the
chief
he
manifests
much
care
of
God's
service
and
never
fails
morning
and
evening
coming
to
prayers
to
the
little
closet
nor
being
an
attentive
hearer
at
sermons
so
as
there
is
all
good
signs
that
God
has
set
him
over
this
kingdom
for
a
blessing

But
God
saw
us
not
worthy
of
such
a
blessing
whose
will
as
it
is
ever
best
whatsoever
it
appear
to
our
sense
so
must
we
submit
ourselves
to
it
in
all
things
though
it
is
the
hardliest
practised
lesson
of
all
we
learn
in
religion

goes
hence
on
Tuesday
through
to
Canterbury
and
so
to
Dover

So
with
the
remembrance
of
my
best
service
to
my
good
Lady
I
commend
you
to
the
protection
of
the
Almighty

the
30
of
Sep

I
thank
God
Ned
is
well
and
I
beg
your
blessing
for
him
and
I
pray
God
preserve
you
well
and
give
you
a
happy
and
speedy
meeting
with

faithful
affectionate
wife
BRILLIANA
HARLEY

I
wish
another
time
had
been
taken
for
that
hasty
business
in
regard
of
the
want
of
so
able
a
man
at
this
time
in
the
upper
house
whether
there
is
no
probability
he
will
be
suffered
to
come
this
session
though
he
were
enlarged

Dear
Sir
--
Your
two
letters
one
from
Hearifort
and
the
other
from
Gloucester
were
very
welcome
to
me
and
if
you
know
how
gladly
I
receive
your
letters
I
believe
you
would
never
let
any
opportunity
pass

I
will
now
bid
you
good
night
for
it
is
past
eleven
o’clock

If
you
do
deliver
it
to
my
father
I
pray
you
seal
it
first

Tom
has
still
a
great
cold
but
he
is
not
I
thank
God
sick
with
it

I
am
confident
if
my
Lady
Bacon
would
take
him
into
her
care
Sir
Thomas
and
my
sister
would
as
they
should
have
a
great
deal
of
reason
to
think
themselves
much
obliged
to
her
Ladyship
for
that
courtesy
she
being
a
friend
which
I
know
they
highly
esteem
of

This
17th
of
June
1629

Sir
Harbottle
Grimston
has
a
great
deal
of
interest
there
and
will
be
as
ready
to
do
you
service
as
anybody

But
I
believe
my
intelligence
will
prove
better
than
his
for
my
Lady
Barrington
who
is
now
in
town
and
presents
her
most
affectionate
service
to
you
told
me
Mister
Chitting
had
some
speech
with
her
concerning
the
gentlewoman
and
would
have
had
her
write
to
you
about
it
to
which
she
made
answer
she
would
not
propound
it
to
you
but
if
upon
her
information
you
took
liking
to
it
she
would
be
ready
to
do
you
any
service
and
would
show
how
glad
she
would
be
that
any
that
had
relation
to
her
might
be
so
happy
as
to
come
under
your
government

And
now
my
paper
reminds
me
I
have
been
so
tedious
to
you
and
bids
me
say
no
more
but
that
I
am
Your
most
loving
faithful
&
humble
servant

If
hereafter
you
please
there
shall
be
any
renewing
of
this
beginning
I
shall
be
faithful
at
your
command
professing
seriously
I
should
think
myself
happy
in
nothing
more
than
in
those
actions
that
might
express
me
Your
Ladyship's
most
affectionate
servant
JUDITH
BARRINGTON

If
some
such
good
occasion
bring
you
not
to
town
I
intend
if
please
God
to
give
me
leave
to
wait
on
you
at
Culford
between
this
and
Easter

Madam
if
your

will
be
pleased
to
make
us
so
happy
as
to
let
us
know
when
we
shall
have
the
honour
of
seeing
you
here
we
will
come
down
to
fetch
you
up

wait
of
your

wheresoever
you
will
appoint

so
once

pardon

HENRIETTE
MARIE
REINE

Given
under
our
hand
at
Newmarket
this
one
and
thirty
day
of
January
1630-31

I
am
in
hope
to
bring
my
husband
at
last
to
the
business
you
sent
for
him
to
Broome
for
concerning
his
estate
which
if
he
does
I
shall
think
it
worth
my
journey
and
when
it
is
done
I
shall
wish
my
self
with
you

I
spoke
to
Mrs
West
who
desired
me
to
return
you
humble
thanks
for
your
favour
and
bounty
to
her
and
her
niece
her
house
will
be
empty
within
a
fortnight
she
says
if
please
you
to
command
it

I
knew
not
how
you
would
like
it
yet
I
let
it
go
on
that
you
might
take
that
occasion
to
speak
with
the
King
and
I
think
it
may
serve
you
for
the
money
well
and
be
a
means
to
get
it
sooner
than
they
can
otherwise
and
it
will
be
a
cause
that
anybody
will
think
sufficient
to
bring
you
to
town

Now
for
Sir
Alexander
Radcliff
and
my
Lady
so
soon
as
I
came
to
London
I
did
write
unto
them
and
sent
those
letters
of
Mister
Meautys's
enclosed
which
as
it
should
seem
they
like
of
very
well
for
he
is
come
to
London
and
tells
me
the
chief
part
of
his
business
is
to
take
me
down
into
the
country
my
Lady
being
very
desirous
to
see
me
so
that
now
I
resolve
to
go
along
with
him

And
thus
wishing
you
the
blessings
of
this
life
and
honour
hereafter
I
rest
Your
most
affectionate
and
truly
sister
ever
to
serve
you
ANNA
MEAUTYS

MOST
DEAR
SISTER
I
HAVE
received
that
money
which
you
was
pleased
to
send
me
by
Mister
Greenhill
which
came
so
conveniently
as
I
could
wish

My
dear
Sir
--
I
pray
you
receive
my
thanks
for
your
letter
by
my
cousin
Pris
and
by
the
carrier
they
were
both
very
welcome
to
me
which
I
think
you
believe
for
in
part
you
know
how
dear
you
are
to
me

She
they
is
religious
and
discreet
and
very
handsome
in
doing
of
any
thing
her
name
is
Buckle
a
Sharpsheare
woman
if
you
like
of
it
I
would
think
of
having
of
her
for
I
have
no
body
about
me
of
any
judgement
to
do
any
thing

May
the
18
1633

I
must
confess
the
hand
is
so
like
my
husband's
that
I
verily
believe
it
came
from
him
but
where
he
should
think
I
should
have
the
money
I
cannot
imagine
and
too
one
of
those
letters
I
sent
to
your
Ladyship
last
was
dated
the
same
day
that
the
merchant’s
note
was
which
was
the
24
of
May
and
in
that
he
spoke
of
no
such
thing

My
Lady
Harborte
with
all
her
youth
and
beauty
is
dead
of
a
spotted
fever
which
is
very
rife
at
London
she
is
much
lamented

Amongst
the
catalogue
of
those
good
works
which
your
fellowcitizens
and
our
countrymen
have
done
this
will
not
be
reckoned
for
the
least
that
they
have
provided
for
the
feeding
of
souls

I
would
have
written
to
Mr.
Busse
but
I
was
loath
to
trouble
him
with
a
long
letter
and
I
feared
I
should
not
receive
an
answer
from
him
from
you
I
expect
one
so
soon
as
conveniently
you
may

My
sister
Jarvess
and

Truly

long

‘P.S.’
I
hope
to
serve
you
in
my
return
with
your
conjunction
we
shall
quickly
put
an

It
may
through
God's
blessing
prove
very
happy

If
you

godly
honest
men
to
be

honest
men
will
follow
them

That
is
all
from
Your
faithful

OLIVER
CROMWELL

I
am
now
ready
for
my
march
towards
the
enemy
who
has
entrenched
himself
over
against
Hull
my
Lord
Newcastle
having
besieged
the
town

I
tell
you
the
business
of
Ireland
and
England
has
had
of
me
in
money
between
eleven
and
twelve
hundred
pounds
--
therefore
my
private
can
do
little
to
help
the
public

Weak
counsels
and
weak
actings
undo
all

And
for
this
we
are
exceedingly
bound
to
the
goodness
of
God
who
brought
our
troops
off
with
so
little
loss

If
these
men
be
accounted
"
troublesome
to
the
country
I
shall
be
glad
you
would
send
them
all
to
me

I
am
confident
they
will
be
well
bestowed

If
the
gentleman
stand
clear
in
your
judgements
I
beg
it
as
a
special
favour
that
if
the
gentleman
be
freely
willing
to
let
me
have
him
for
my
money
let
him
set
his
own
price
I
shall
very
justly
return
him
the
money

"
He
is
indiscreet

I
know
you
will
not
think
it
fit
my
Lord
should
discharge
an
officer
of
the
field
but
in
a
regulate
way


Let
Barnard
return
therefore
take
a
lower
level
where
the
ways
are
more
sheltered
in
stormy
weather

and
so
save
himself
and
"

Recorder
after
the
Restoration

If
you
shall
therefore
think
fit
to
send
one
over
unto
us
to
be
with
us
at
night
you
do
not
know
how
far
we
may
prevail
with
him
to
draw
speedily
to
a
head
with
Sir
John
Gell
and
the
other
forces
where
we
may
all
meet
at
a
general
rendezvous
to
the
end
you
know
of

I
understand
that
you
have
lately
released
some
persons
committed
by
Major
Ireton
and
Captain
all
'committed'
upon
clear
and
necessary
grounds
as
they
are
represented
unto
me
'grounds'
rendering
them
as
very
enemies
as
any
we
have
and
as
much
requiring
to
have
them
continued

physical

you
please

shall

a
lingering
progress

have
your

further

little
care

any

have
from
his

the

an
ill

he

Sweden

We
have
yet
here
no
particulars
of
this
defeat

in
general
it
is
a
very
great
one

I
am
very
sorry
for
my
Lord

sickness

I
hope
you
will
send

the

of
the

will
not

I
made

more
hast
away
the
next
day
because
I
had
no
mind
to
speak
with

of

they
may

good
friends
My
Lord
Strickland
who
is
one
of

did
impart
to
us
a
letter
written
from
yourselves
to

to
your
desire

expressed

occasions

who
are
of
the
same
hope

faith

you
I
thought
fit
to
commend
written
in
your
heart

to
do

your
judicious
choice
of
that
person
to

you
have

our

an

measure
with
myself

SIR
I
have
seen
your
last
letter
to
Mr.
Secretary
as
also
divers
others
and
although
I
have
no
doubt
either
of
your
diligence
or
ability
to
serve
us
in
so
great
a
business
yet
I
am
deeply
sensible
that
the
French
are
very
much
short
with
us
in
ingenuousness
and
performance

And
`in
fine,'
that
consideration
may
be
had
how
our
men
may
be
put
into
a
position
to
be
returned
to
us
whom
we
hope
we
shall
employ
to
a
better
purpose
than
to
have
them
continue
where
they
are

Since
when
we
have
had
little
new
but
only
been
making
a
progress
in
those
things
I
then
mentioned

Order
likewise
is
given
for

up
all

votes

of

of

chapters
lands
into
an
act
which
I
should
be
glad
to
see
passed

1660
Gentlemen
I
have
been
today
with
my
Lord
Bellasis
to
deliver
your
letter
which
with
the
petition
of
the
taylors
enclosed
he
read
and
with
much
readiness
and
courtesy
promised
this
night
by
the
post
to
give
the
most
effectual
orders
to
Colonel
Gilby
that
he
should
fulfil
all
things
as
you
desire
therein
as
far
as
will
consist
with
the
act
of
parliament
concerning
soldiers
exercising
trades
and
particularly
witnessed
to
me
his
own
resolution
as
much
as
might
be
to
entertain
no
soldiers
that
should
have
any
trade
but
that
of
their
soldiery

By
how
much
our
time
is
shorter
I
shall
the
more
daily
and
diligently
give
you
advice
of
all
that
passes

It
is
said
that
on
Sunday
next
Doctor
Reynolds
shall
be
created
Bishop
of
Norwich

We
must
first
give
you
thanks
for
the
kind
present
you
have
pleased
to
send
us
which
will
give
occasion
to
us
to
remember
you
often
but
the
quantity
is
so
great
that
it
might
make
sober
men
forgetful

For
pains
and
penalties

For
purchasers
etc.
Beside
those
which
yet
lie
before
the
lords
since
our
last
recess
not
sent
back
to
us

For
strict
observing
Lord’s
day

This
two
or
three
days
we
have
been
chiefly
about
the
6
months
assess

We
hope
you
will
be
private
in
these
things
communicated
to
you
out
of
faithfulness
to
your
interest
and
that
you
will
not
be
hasty
in
your
resolutions
nor
open
one
way
or
other

But
indeed
we
perceive
that
my
Lord
Bellasis
was
very
little
informed
by
Mr.
Hebird
wherein
or
in
what
way
he
should
befriend
him
neither
has
Mr.
Hebird
in
all
this
time
ever
been
with
either
of
us
who
might
then
have
afforded
our
assistance

Here
is
a
conspiracy
detected
against
his
majesty's
person

The
one
bill
taking
the
Court
of
Wards
and
the
duty
of
purveyance
for
one
moiety
in
perpetuum

God
has
laid
a
soar
affliction
upon
his
Majesty’s
family
and
therein
upon
the
whole
nation

Today
the
committee
having
yesterday
gone
through
the
Act
for
Security
of
his
Majesty’s
person
all
the
amendments
were
read
and
agreed
to
and
the
bill
put
to
engrossing

I
am
Your
most
affectionate
friend
to
serve
you
Andrew
Marvell

Though
this
seem
something
longsome
to
us
and
you
who
are
equally
desirous
of
the
effect
yet
nothing
is
long
that
is
necessary
nor
that
time
lost
which
makes
the
business
at
last
go
of
clearer

To
Mayor
Richardson

I
am
infinitely
overjoyed
to
hear
of
your
safe
arrival
and
now
my
dear
friend
I
think
it
will
not
be
improper
after
the
promises
you
made
me
at
our
parting
to
put
you
in
mind
of
seeing
me
here
to
purchase
which
passionately
I
own
my
joy
being
a
self
lover

O

My
humble
service
to
your
sister
the
country
now
is
so
pleasant
that
though
my
Lord
is
at
London
and
this
place
is
solitary
enough
yet
I
will
swear
I
never
in
my
life
passed
my
time
with
more
solid
satisfaction
pray
answer
this
as
soon
as
possibly
you
can
for
I
am
impatient
to
hear
the
success
of
this
bill

MY
DEAR
FRIEND
my
removal
from
Bredby
to
the
waters
where
I
now
am
and
a
great
deal
of
company
that
left
me
not
till
the
day
I
began
my
journey
hither
hindered
me
ever
since
I
received
your
last
letter
from
writing
to
you
and
this
place
is
so
much
duller
than
that
from
whence
I
came
that
could
the
waters
work
a
miracle
there
is
no
living
in
so
hot
and
dirty
a
place
though
I
did
not
absolutely
despair
of
your
having
good
nature
enough
after
living
so
long
in
the
barbarous
town
of
London
as
we
country
ladies
call
it
to
make
a
journey
hither
I
would
dissemble
as
town
ones
do
and
discover
as
I
have
done
the
facts
of
but
without
rallery
I
have
heard
you
complain
of
the
spleen
and
they
all
esteem
the
waters
of
this
place
the
best
cure
of
the
vapours
of
it
which
are
certainly
less
supportable
than
the
pain
of
anything
that
can
be
given
pray
consider
one's
.advice
that
has
lived
long
enough
in
a
cold
melancholy
air
to
be
perfectly
learned
in
all
the
points
of
that
distemper
and
if
you
have
found
the
trouble
of
it
as
much
as
you
will
seeking
to
oblige
me
send
me
word
that
you
will
come
and
be
cured
with
-YOURS
FOREVER

Poor
woman
I
am
sorry
for
her
it is
certain
the
dread
of
us
that
frights
her
away

Sadler
and
he
go
by
together
tomorrow
then
you
may
see
him
and
satisfy
yourself
but
with
all
this
I
must
tell
you
too
that
they
say
Sadler
is
generally
taken
notice
on
for
a
gift
he
had
of
lying
and
therefore
what
his
mares
will
come
to
I
cannot
tell

For
my
highly
honoured
Mrs.
Temple
at
her
lodgings
at
Mr.
Winn's
house
near
the
horse-shoe
in
St.
Martin's
Lane
London

Jeffries
who
first
sent
me
word
of
it
to
get
the
printer
punished
the
book
called
in
and
me
some
way
publicly
vindicated
yet
I
shall
need
all
my
friends
to
be
my
champions
to
the
critical
and
malicious
that
I
am
so
innocent
of
this
pitiful
design
of
a
knave
to
get
a
groat
that
I
never
was
more
vexed
at
anything
and
that
I
utterly
disclaim
whatever
he
has
so
unhandsomely
exposed

The
Duchess
of
Richmond
looks
very
well
but
it
does
no
wonders
except
my
Lord
of
Bristol's
fits
of
the
Mother
which
he
has
very
often
and
weeps
after
them
like
a
woman

28th
(
1668)

My
service
to
your
Brothers
and
sister

Do
not
impute
my
silence
to
neglect
had
you
seen
me
these
ten
days
continually
entertaining
persons
of
different
humour
age
and
sense
not
only
at
meals
or
afternoon
or
the
time
of
a
civil
visit
but
from
morning
till
night
you
will
be
assured
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
finish
these
few
lines
sooner
so
often
have
I
set
pen
to
paper
and
been
taken
off
again
that
I
almost
despaired
to
let
you
know
my
satisfaction
that
Jack
complies
so
well
with
your
desires
and
that
I
am
your
friend
and
servant
M.
Evelyn

I
am
Your
loving
mother
Mary
Evelyn

The
Sergeant
was
sent
into
the
Speakers
Chamber
with
the
mace
to
bring
them
to
receive
the
sentence
upon
his
knees
at
the
Bare

It
cannot
be
the
effect
of
his
discernment
which
makes
him
give
sentence
in
my
behalf
being
such
a
great
master
of
reason
as
he
is
but
it
is
certainly
a
mark
of
his
great
kindness
to
you
that
be
defers
to
your
judgment
in
opposition
to
his
own

But
why
do
we
always
look
back
into
times
past

Sir
Do
not
think
my
silence
hitherto
has
proceeded
from
being
taken
up
with
the
diversions
of
the
town
the
éclat
of
the
wedding
masquerades
which
trebled
their
number
the
second
night
of
the
wedding
so
that
there
was
great
disorder
and
confusion
caused
by
it
and
with
which
the
solemnity
ended
neither
can
I
charge
the
housewifery
of
the
country
after
my
return
or
treating
my
neighbours
this
Christmas
since
I
never
find
any
business
or
recreation
that
makes
me
forget
my
friends

Madame
I
acknowledge
these
are
trials
which
make
Christian
philosophy
useful
not
only
by
a
resignation
to
the
divine
degree
but
by
that
hope
which
encourages
us
to
expect
a
more
lasting
happiness
than
any
this
world
can
give

You
need
not
to
be
made
sensible
by
a
character
of
a
person
you
knew
so
well
and
you
can
enumerate
virtues
enough
to
lament
and
shed
some
tears
justly
therefore
spares
me
the
sorrow
of
repeating
what
effect
it
has
wrought
on
such
a
mind
as
mine
who
thinks
no
misfortune
worth
regretting
besides
the
loss
of
those
I
love

Remember
what
pains
I
have
formerly
taken
to
wean
you
from
your
pernicious
resolutions
of
discretion
and
wisdom

For
Mr.
Henry
Savile
Leave
it
at
the
porters
lodge
in
Whitehall
desiring
them
to
deliver
it
with
care
and
speed
The
alteration
of
my
mother's
former
resolutions
(
who
is
now
resolved
against
ever
moving
from
hence
puts
me
upon
some
thoughts
which
were
almost
quite
out
of
my
head
but
you
may
be
sure
I
shall
determine
nothing
that
does
not
tend
as
much
to
your
real
happiness
as
lies
in
my
power

Present
my
humble
duty
to
my
Lady
Warre
whose
favours
will
ever
be
in
my
grateful
memory
my
humble
service
to
Lady
La
Warre
to
cousin
Betty
sweet
honey
Mrs.
Windham
the
sprite
and
the
little
girl
whom
my
soul
loves

Today
the
House
has
not
sat

So
the
business
of
angel’s
lights
is
for
tomorrow

The
apprehensions
of
the
Hollanders
closing
up
their
Peace
with
France
do
still
continue
and
rather
increase
then
otherwise

The
first
of
170
against
167

This
last
was
long
debated
none
being
willing
to
give
a
negative
but
neither
forward
to
an
affirmative
in
the
uncertainty
of
war
or
peace

It
is
probable
the
continuance
of
the
additional
duty
on
French
and
other
wines
may
then
to
be
considered

The
House
of
Commons
opened
their
session
as
is
usual
with
reading
a
bill
and
that
which
was
pitched
upon
was
the
former
bill
for
regulating
the
collection
of
hearthmoney
and
then
they
appointed
a
day
for
its
second
reading

Several
things
of
the
like
public
and
good
intention
were
set
on
foot
again
which
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
come
to
perfection

That
it
does
appear
to
this
House
that
an
160000
pounds
has
been
borrowed
on
the
excise
and
has
been
expended
on
the
extraordinary
charge
of
the
navy

This
carried
by
202
against

Gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
Yesterday
the
bill
for
burying
in
woollen
was
reported
from
the
committee
and
ordered
to
be
engrossed

(
that
is
a
ledge
of
towns
dividing
the
French
and
Spaniard

--78

You
say
your
book
is
like
to
be
reprinted
probably
the
first
part
not
the
second
which
was
printed
since

Have
a
care
of
your
health
this
hot
season

I
once
dissected
a
bear
which
dyed
in
Norwich
and
I
have
the
lower
jaw
and
teeth
its
a
strong
animal
has
notable
sinews
and
muscles
and
teeth

Now
is
your
time
to
be
frugal
and
lay
up

I
doubt
these
will
not
be
shown
at
Barholomew
Fair
where
every
one
may
see
them
for
his
money

Mr.
Parsons
his
sermon
is
like
to
sell
well

I
do
not
find
it
in
Dr
Listers
table
of
spiders
though
he
has
written
well
de
Araneis

I
am
glad
to
hear
that
Sir
Arthur
Ingraham
is
so
well
as
to
go
abroad
into
the
country
and
also
so
kind
as
to
remember
you
with
a
present
of
wine
which
may
do
you
more
service
in
the
winter
than
in
this
hot
and
sickly
weather
for
'it is
likely
to
be
of
the
most
spirituous
and
heady
sort

I
should
be
glad
to
see
the
book
and
read
it
for
I
doubt
it
is
not
at
least
as
yet
of
common
sale

You
may
take
good
notice
of
what
he
says
therein
for
you
cannot
choose
but
meet
with
many
questions
from
women
with
child
but
this
little
to
be
questioned
that
the
book
you
read
of
the
projection
at
Vienna
and
the
history
of
it
will
find
many
Readers
for
the
like
has
not
been
written
where
the
powder
has
been
put
to
sale
and
so
the
verity
thereof
been
so
subject
unto
triall

I
rest
Y.l.f

What
is
this
world
when
we
recall
past
things

But
do
not
think
that
those
mighty
thanks
you
heap
upon
me
for
it
in
your
last
ought
to
make
me
forget
the
solid
obligations
I
have
to
you

What
parts
you
find
I
have
either
wholly
omitted
or
too
slightly
touched
on
I
desire
you
to
remind
me
of

I
have
formerly
mentioned
Æsop's
Fables
or
some
such
other
book
of
pleasant
stories
to
draw
him
on
with
delight
in
reading

For
you
must
not
think
of
trial
or
changing
afterwards
that
will
cause
great
inconvenience
to
you
and
greater
to
him

Sir
The
manner
wherewith
you
continue
to
speak
of
the
advice
I
have
ventured
to
send
you
concerning
your
son
makes
me
fear
that
in
perusing
it
you
more
regard
the
intention
and
friendship
of
the
author
than
the
meanness
of
the
thing
itself
since
you
so
far
mistake
it
as
to
think
that
it
has
laid
the
debt
on
your
side
and
such
an
one
as
you
imagine
you
can
never
get
out
of
which
when
I
on
the
other
side
consider
your
favours
I
conclude
I
have
all
the
reason
in
the
world
to
say
in
your
own
words
that
I
must
forever
remain
your

This
is
enough
for
your
Scotch
friend
to
know
to
see
to
what
terms
he
will
come
which
when
they
are
judged
reasonable
or
near
the
matter
the
patent
now
in
the
executors'
hands
will
be
forthcoming
time
enough
if
the
mice
have
not
eaten
it
as
I
believe
not
in
a
strong
wooden
chest
where
he
was
wont
to
keep
it
and
which
Adrian
had
the
direction
to
open
which
I
remember
was
this
You
must
turn
the
key
with
the
sun
once
round
and
a
quarter
and
then
turn
it
back
again
half
a
round
and
so
let
it
stand

Pray
present
my
humble
service
to
her
and
let
her
know
I
should
be
glad
if
there
were
anything
here
for
her
service

Though
I
gave
you
an
account
by
memorandum
that
I
thought
abele
trees
were
to
be
got
as
good
or
better
nearer
home
than
from
hence
it
was
not
to
spare
myself
the
trouble
of
sending
them
since
I
have
not
so
much
pleasure
in
anything
as
when
I
am
doing
you
some
service

It
is
true
they
are
quickly
up
but
what
are
they
good
for
when
grown

The
promise
of
lime
tree
seeds
has
failed
me

I
had
designed
her
a
long
letter
by
a
Lady
of
her
acquaintance
I
parted
with
not
long
since
at
the
Brill

For
there
are
so
many
repetitions
in
it
and
so
many
things
still
misplaced
that
though
I
venture
it
confused
as
it
is
to
your
friendship
yet
I
cannot
think
these
papers
in
a
condition
to
be
showed
anyone
else
till
by
another
review
I
have
reduced
them
into
yet
better
order

London
16th
March
1687-8

as
you
desire
could
I
have
gotten
time
during
his
stay
here
to
have
done
it
but
now
I
think
I
must
take
a
time
by
your
directions
and
in
your
presence
to
do
it
which
if
God
bless
my
wife
with
an
happy
lyingin
and
no
extraordinary
business
prevent
my
inclinations
do
very
strongly
prompt
me
to

London
5th
June
1688

your
friend
Mrs.
R.S

Mr.
Oakley
goes
not
out
of
town
until
Monday
next
but
gives
his
service
to
you
and
desires
to
know
if
you
have
received
his
letter

You
have
exceedingly
obliged
my
gardener
by
your
jonquils
and
the
large
nasturtium
indicum
seed
you
have
sent
him
which
we
hear
are
safely
arrived
at
Topsom
by
Spicer
and
I
hope
some
time
the
next
week
to
get
them
safe
hither

May

We
came
on
Monday
in
the
evening
and
just
before
the
Duchess
had
a
letter
from
Lady
Scarborough
to
tell
her
she
went
to
London
today
for
a
fortnight
and
intended
to
see
me
at
Moore
Park
as
she
went
by
so
your
charm
is
not
yet
ended
which
hindered
us
from
meeting
two
summers
but
I
had
a
letter
yesterday
from
her
to
desire
that
it
may
be
when
the
Duchess
of
Somerset
comes
to
stay
there
a
fortnight
which
is
to
be
as
soon
as
she
returns
from
London
and
while
the
Duke
goes
to
Marlborough

I
beg
of
God
Almighty
to
support
you
and
my
father
under
it
and
that
you
would
not
neglect
yourselves
since
it
cannot
at
all
be
of
any
advantage
to
those
we
have
lost
and
will
be
much
the
contrary
to
them
that
are
left
behind
