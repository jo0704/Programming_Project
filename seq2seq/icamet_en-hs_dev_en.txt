though
it

by

I
suppose
to
see
you
on
Palm
Sunday

Also
as
touching
the
person
of
Dudecote
he
was
with
me
and
as
when
I
spoke
with
him
last
at
Hampden
he
said
he
would
pay
to
me
the
money
the
which
I
wrote
to
him
for
so
that
I
would
suffer
him
to
have
a
priest
to
serve
his
church
and
he
to
dwell
with
me
and
where
I
would
suffer
him
but
I
granted
him
not
his
asking
but
yet
nevertherless
to
put
all
things
in
rest
and
for
cause
he
has
christened
a
child
of
mine
and
I
hold
it
best
to
suffer
him
a
while
to
be
absent
and
I
pray
you
he
is
now
at
London
enquire
how
he
governs
him
there
and
send
me
word

Written
at
Sudely
the
4
day
of
April

eccleciæ

The
parson
of
Stockton
told
me
if
you
would
buy
her
a
gown
her

would
give

And
God
and
our

have
you
evermore
in
their
gracious
keeping

And
on
this
Sunday
in
slandering
of
me
he
passed
to
Saint
Ebbis
and
gert
his
brother
and
the
parish
priest
pace
with
him
and
would
let
no
mass
be
said
nor
service
done
to
the
parish
within
the
church
of
Coldingham
and
I
was
not
content
thereof
and
came
to
Coldingham
the
same
Sunday
late
at
evening
and
spoke
somewhat
with
dean
John
Pencher
for
a
pair
of
evidences
that
was

to

he
fulfilled
the
evidence
there
should
never
be

between
us
while
I
was
living

Wherefore
most
gracious

Christian
Prince
we
beseech
your
high

noble
grace
that
you
will
open
your
eyes
of
pity
and
compassion
upon
your
true
subjects
here
which
as
now
live
in
great
dread
and
without
that
help
be
had
the
rather
are
like
to
perish
and
that
you
will
also
call
unto
your
consideration
how
this
your
Duchy
of
Guienne
is
one of
the oldest
lordships
longing
to
your
crown
of
England
and
thereupon
of
your
most
merciful
and
pitious
grace
command
and
do
such
diligence
be
had
that
your
succours
be
sent
in
hasty
time
after
the
form
of
your
said
letters
so
that
by
negligence
or
delays
it
come
not
too
late
and
inconvenience
irrecuperable
be
grown
in
the
meantime
which
God
defend
in
such
wise
also
that
we
are
found
no
gabbers
in
executing
your
commandment
and
declaring
your
letters

Please
it
your
highness
to
wit
the
tidings
of
this
country
that
on
Friday
the
third
day
of
August
the
city
of
Aix
which
is
held
the
strongest
of
all
Guienne
was
won
and
your
adversary
was
in
hit
and
his
son
called
the
Dauphin
with
the
Constable
and
Marshal
of
France
forthwith
have
laid
siege
unto
your
city
of
Baion
which
as
they
say
makes
them
sure
to
have
it
within
8
days
and
from
thence
straight
to
come
to
Bordeaux
where
as
God
knows
is
division
and
never
was
so
little
help
nor
store
of
English
people
the
lack
of
whom
is
cause
of
loss
of
all
this
country
as
we
doubt
not
unless
that
succour
be
had
without
any
delay
all
is
gone

Nevertheless
the
castle
holds
as
yet
and
within
it
for
lack
of
other
help
there
been
of
our
fellowship
all
such
as
we
might
spare
God
send
them
comfort
and
more
help
by
time

Over
this
at
the
request
of
your
counsel
here
and
for
our
true
acquittal
we
advise
as
we
dare
your
Highness
for
the
well
of
you
and
of
this
your
country
here
not
lightly
to
pass
upon
such
grants
of
your
demesnes
or
of
other
lands
rents
or
revenues
here
as
peradventure
shall
be
asked
of
your
said
Highness
but
that
it
please
your
Majesty
to abide
the
advise
of
your
said
counsel
which
purpose
by
commune
and
moor
deliberation
to ascertain
your
said
Majesty
of
such
inconveniences
as
by
such
grants
have
grown
herebefore
and
in
what
wise
they
may
for
your
well
be
eschewed
hereafter

Wherefore
I
beseech
you
at
the
reverence
of
Saint
Cuthbert
who
is
your
patron
and
whose
rights
you
are
in
manner
bound
to
sustain
and
defend
that
you
will
labour
to
our
sovereign
lorde
the
King
for
his
gracious

to
our

father
the
Pope
for
the
good
speed
and
furthering
of
our
said
matters
after
the
form
conceived
by
my
most
worshipful
lord
cardinal
of
York
by
whom
I
and
my
brethren
are
ruled
and
governanced
in
this
cause
which
form
the
bearer
of
this
letter
if
it
please
you
shall
deliver
to
you

Written

Apostle

Wherefore
after
this
grievous
complaint
as
was
before
said
made
unto
me
I
your
priest
and
beadsman
before
that
I
would
in
any
wise
proceed
to
any
correction
as
I
am
bidden
under
pine
of
damnation
to
do
have
been
delibered
in
myself
to
let
your
noble
lordship
have
witting
thereof
to
the
intent
that
it
may
not
by
reason
be
deemed
or
supposed
that
any
will
should
pass
virtue
or
headiness
offend
the
virtue
of
humility
or
patience
and
also
to
the intent
that
I
may
have
herein
some
manner
understanding
and
feeling
of
your
blessed
disposition
whereof
I
lowly
beseech
you
and
as
far
as
I
may
in
God's
behalf
require
you
in
some
ways
to
be
consorted
and
ascertained
by
the
bearer
of
this
my
simple
sorrow

How
the
said
Richard
Druell
and
William
Speere
speeded
when
they
came
to
London
it
appears
in
a
schedule
by
the
said
Richard
Druell
and
William
Speer
thereof
made
remaining
with
the
said
Rychard
Druell

We
met
and
spoke
with
him
in
the
inner
chamber
he
at
that
time
being
right
busy
going
in
to
his
closet

The
justice
said
he
would
be
ready
at
his
calling

And
so
departed
etc.

And
there
is
a
man
in
Truntch
*called
Palmer
too
that
had
of
your
father
certain
land
in
Truntch
over
7
years
or
8
years
ago
for
corn
and
truly
has
paid
all
the
years
and
now
he
has
suffered
the
corn
to
be
withset
for
8
s
of
rent
to
Gymmyngham
which
your
father
paid
never

And
moreover
in
supplement
of
the
foresaid
sum
it
is
my
will
and
my
brother
afore
rehearsed
that
you
take
the
hands
of
the
arrearage
of
his
time
that
is
unraised
of
Dan
Richard
Wrake
which
arrearage
you
have
stopped
as
it
is
said
against
right
and
my
brother
aforesaid
has
exhibited
and
shown
to
me
a
bill
of
notable
costs
charges
and
expense
made
by
him
in
the
time
he
stood
Prior
there
which
is
no
fiend
thing
as
he
refers
him
to
his
brothers
that
was
with
him
and
has
knowledge
thereof
as
he
will
prove
in
time
and
place
required
in
that
party

great
vessels
of
the
enemies

Written
at
Paston
on
Monday
after
Hallowmess
Day

And
I
let
him
*know
he
that
put
it
down
shall
pay
therefore

Right
worshipful
and
my
full
trusty
and
specially
beloved
sir
I
recommend
me
to
you
in

favour
and

true
love

times
beseeching
you
as
my
singular
trust
is

has
been

In
all
these
matters
I
pray
you
prove
you
a
good

to
Saint
Cuthbert
and
a
steadfast

we
bear
full
trust
and
affiance
in

And
say
Elizabeth
Paston
that
she
must
use
herself
to
work
readily
as
other
gentlewomen
do
and
somewhat
to
help
herself
therewith

And
in
all
other
things
as
to
my
Lady
Pool
with
whom
I
sojourned
that
you
will
be
my
tender
and
good
mother
that
she
may
be
paid
for
all
the
costs
done
to
me
before
my
marriage
and
to
Cristofre
Hanson
as
you
wrote
unto
my
brother
John
that
it
should
have
been
so

Other
tidings
I
can
none
send
but
I
beseech
the
holy
ghost
be
your

The

On

were
kept

and

20
persons

Yours

They
said
their
coming
was
but
to
take
out
such
riotous
people
as
was
here
within
this
place
and
such
as
were
the
King's
felonies
and
indited
and
outlawed
men
nevertheless
they
would
show
no
warrants
whereby
to
take
none
such
though
there
had
been
such
here

Please
it
you
to
know
that
on
Friday
after
my
departing
from
you
I
was
at
Sudbury
and
spoke
with
the
sheriff
and
Richard
Calle
*gave
him
the
two
writs

Written
the
Friday
next
before
Michaelmas
Day

I
spoke
with
Sir

Hevenyngham
and
informed
him
with
the
trough
of
the
matter
and
of
all
our
demeaning
at
Drayton
and
he
said
he
would
that
all
thing
were
well
and
that
he
would
inform
my
Lord
as
I
said
to
him
but
Harleston
had
all
the
words
and
the
rule
with
the
Duke
here
and
after
his
advice
and
Doctor
Aleyne's
he
was
advised
here
at
this
time

Right
worshipful
husband
I
recommend
me
to
you
I
was
at
Haylesdon
upon
Thursday
last
past
and
saw
the
place
there
and
in
good
faith
there
will
no
creature
think
how
foul
and
horribly
it
is
arrayed
but
if
they
saw
it

The
mayor
of
Norwich
did
arrest
the
bailiff
of
Normandies
Lovegold
Gregory
Cordonere
and
Bartholomew
Fuller
without
any
authority
save
only
he
says
that
he
has
a
commandment
of
the
Duke
to
do
so
and
he
will
not
let
them
out
of
prison
till
he
had
surete
for
each
of
them
in
4
pounds
for
to
awnswer
to
such
matters
as
the
Duke
and
his
council
will
put
against
them
at
any
time
that
they
be
called
and
so
will
he
do
to
others
as
many
as
he
may
get
that
owe
you
any
good
will

After
that
I
tarried
at
Dover
more
than
10
days
abiding
passage
the
which
was
right
perilous

the

of
mists

loved

and
my

Trusty

by

that
you
have
taken
upon
you
now
of
late
to
make
masteries
within
our
forest
and
chase
of
Barnewood
and
Exsille
and
that
in
contempt
of
us
uncourteously
to
hunt
and
slay
our
deer
within
the
same
to
our
great
marvel
and
displeasure
we
will
you
wit
that
we
intend
to
sue
such
remedy
therein
as
shall
accord
with
my
lord’s
laws

Sir
I
understand
the
good
that
comes
now
from
London
and
Ippswich
must
pay
part
of
the
same
payment

And
as
for
master
Lowys
More
Lomberd
is
paid
and
I
have
the
bill

Item
sir
your
wool
is
awarded
by
the
sarplier
that
I
cast
out
last
etc.

Wherefore
the
general
stands
in
non
affect
and
so
many
as
are
here
having
no
singular
safeconduct
are
in
jeopardy

per
your
servant
William
Cely

No
more
unto
your
masterships
at
this
time
but
almighty
Jesus
preserve
you

And
the
rest
of
your
300
pounds
remains
still
by
me
for
I
can
make
you
over
no
more
at
this
season
for
here
is
no
more
that
will
take
any
money
as
yet

But
sir
I
cannot
have
your
wool
yet
awarded
for
I
have
do
cast
out
a
sarplier
the
which
is
pointed
by
the
lieutenant
to
be
cast
out
to
ward
the
sort
by
as
the
ordinance
is
now
made
that
the
lieutenant
shall
point
the
warding
sarpliers
of
every
man's
wool
the
which
sarplier
that
I
have
cast
out
is
No.
24
and
therein
is
found
by
William
Smith
packer
a
60
middle
fleeces
and
it
is
a
very
gruff
wool
and
so
I
have
caused
William
Smith
privily
to
cast
out
another
sarplier

To
the
worshipful
Sir
Robert
Plompton
knight
be
this
delivered
in
haste

And
he
will
not
let
him
have
them
without
a
replevin
and
I
trow
he
will
die
in
the
field
for
I
sent
William
Skirgell
and
William
Croft
and
they
cannot
get
him
without
a
*caution

But
my
son
keeps
them
forth
as
yet
and
therefore
I
trust
my
Lord
Archbishop
will
complain
of
my
son
and
you
and
said
that
he
will
indict
them
that
was
at
casting
out
of
them

And
I
pray
you
to
send
some
writing
to
Thomas
Meryng
for
the
repayment
of
the
money
and
your
discharge

To
master
Thomas
Everingam
be
this
delivered
in
haste

You
shall
hear
here
these
matters
that
we
intend
to
common
of
but
first
you
shall
be
both
sworn
upon
a
book
that
you
shall
never
utter
nothing
that
is
now
here
spoken
without
it
be
to
the
King's
grace
if
need
shall
require
or
else
to
non
living
creature

Item
my
master
your
deputy
said
"
My
Lord
Chamberlain
was
very
slack
in
one
journey
wherewith
I
know well
that
the
King's
grace
was
discontent
for
and
he
had
done
his
part
well
the
Cornish
men
had
never
made
the
King
fell
at
Blake
heath
but
had
all
been
destroyed
long
before
their
coming
thither
that
I
know well
the
King's
grace
had
liefer
had
be
done
than
20
thousand
for
his
honour

Then
said
Sir
Hughe
Conway
to
him
again
"
I
pray
you
suffer
me
to
tell
forth
my
tale
for
I
am
not
yet
atthe
end

At
last
he
asked
what
he
was
that
told
me
thus
tale
of
his
departing

Item
after
this
the
treasurer
said
"
Master
deputy
and
master
porter
what
danger
are
we
in
now
remembering
all
things
well
for
we
have
no
such
holds
to
resort
unto
as
these
other
men
have
considering
also
our
many
enemies
that
we
have
in
this
town
and
else
where
that
will be
glad
to
destroy
and
murder
us
all
if
other
should
come
to
the
King’s
grace
than
weal

Let
not
us
think
the
contrary
but
and
the
King’s
were
once
departed
she
being
in
the
castle
here
and
Edmond
De
la
Pole
her
cousin
at
his
liberty
but
that
she
would
help
him
in
his
causes
with
all
her
power
and
to
let
him
come
into
this
town
by
the
postern
of
the
castle
to
the
destruction
of
us
all

Item
then
said
my
master
your
deputy
"
If
such
thing
shall
happen
as
I
pray
God
that
I
never
live
to
see
the
King’s
grace
to
depart
before
me
but
and
it
please
God
that
he
shall
so
do
to
be
for
the
surety
and
use
of
my
Lord
prince
and
for
all
my
master's
children
to
have
this
town
all
times
at
their
own
will
and
rule
and
rather
than
it
should
be
otherwise
I
had
liefer
suffer
death

And
also
Sir
I
will
not
let
Thomas
Croft
wife
plow
nor
occupy
her
fermeald
but
said
she
shall
not
occupy
without
your
life

Sir
I
beseech
you
to
remember
your
great
cost
and
charges
and
mine
and
labour
the
matter
that
it
might
have
an
end
for
they
have
taken
on
capias
and
delivered
for
certain
of
your
tenants

No
more
at
this
time
but
the
Trinity
keep
you

From
Plompton
in
haste
the
13th
day
of
April

By
your
wife
(
26
April
1504

God
send
me
comfort
to
his
pleasure
and
that
I
and
mine
that
be
left
here
with
me
be
well
entreated
such
ways
as
they
have
taken

I
will
beseech
you
and
him
to
take
no
displeasure
with
me
for
my
departing
for
it
will be
no
otherwise
my
heart
is
so
sad

All
which
things
according
to
your
desire
and
pleasure
I
have
with
all
my
heart
and
good
will
given
and
granted
unto
you

Wherefore
eftsoons
in
my
most
humble
wise
I
thank
you
and
I
purpose
hereafter
at
better
leisure
to
know
your
mind
and
pleasure
further
therein

Sir
there
is
land
in
Rybston
field
that
Christopher
Chambers
would
buy
if
you
will
sell
it
but
I
am
not
assured
what
he
will
give
for
it

Wherefore
I
humbly
beseech
you
to
be
so
good
and
kind
father
unto
me
as
to
let
me
know
your
pleasure
how
that
you
will
have
me
ordered
as
shortly
as
it
shall
like
you

But
my
dear
heart
I
will
no
more
encumber
your
Grace
with
further
writing
in
this
matter
for
I
am
Sir
your
chaplin
and
servant
Doctor
Whytston
has
shown
your
Highness
the
circumstance
of
the
same

Edith
Neville

And
I
pray
you
madam
let
not
my
Mrs
your
daughter
wit
of
it
for
then
she
will
never
trust
my
husband
nor
me

Our
husband
knows
it
is
withheld
for
his
sake
and
will
recompense
us
safer
as
the
Doctor
show
him

I
was
very
glad
to
hear
the
meeting
of
them
both
which
has
been
to
my
seeming
the
greatest
honour
to
the
King
that
ever
came
to
Prince

In
this
your
grace
shall
see
how
I
can
keep
my
promise
sending
you
for
your
banners
a
King’s
coat

MASTER
Almoner
when
the
last
messenger
went
I
wrote
not
to
you
because
I

of

My
most

loving

I
heartily
recommend
me
unto
you

And
now
am
I
left
post
alone
in
effect
for
on
the
morn
next
after
e
marriage
my
chamberlain
with
all
other
men
servants
were
discharged
and
in
like
wise
my
mother
Guldford
with
other
my
women
and
maidens
except
such
as
never
had
experience
nor
knowledge
how
to
advertise
or
give
me
counsel
in
any
time
of
need
which
is
to
be
feared
more
shortly
than
your
Grace
thought
at
the
time
of
my
departing
as
my
mother
Guldford
can
more
plainly
show
your
Grace
than
I
can
write
to
whom
I
beseech
you
to
give
credence

But
for
any
thing
I
might
do
in
no
wise
might
I
have
any
grant
for
her
abode
here
which
I
assure
you
my
lord
is
much
to
my
discomfort
beside
many
other
discomforts
that
you
would
full
little
have
thought

But
I
trust
that
both
I
and
my
said
Lord
shall
see
you
according
as
your
Grace
wrote
in
your
last
letters
unto
my
said
Lord
which
is
the
thing
that
I
desire
more
to
obtain
than
all
the
honour
of
the
World

Your
friend
MARGARET
R.
My
lord
Cardinal
I
recommend
me
heartily
to
you
and
I
am
glad
to
hear
that
you
do
well
and
I
have
received
a
letter
from
you
and
another
from
my
lord
Dakers
whereof
I
believe
you
know
the
effect

Nevertheless
I
am
credibly
informed
that
my
almoner
is
disappointed
of
the
said
prebend
and
that
your
chaplain
has
it
of
the
which
I
marvel
greatly
forasmuch
as
my
said
almoner
has
done
me
good
service
in
this
country
to
the
great
honour
of
the
king
my
brother
and
mine
also
and
that
the
promise
was
made
undesired
of
my
behalf
for
you
were
the
person
that
only
moved
the
king
to
give
it
unto
my
almoner
and
I
am
assured
that
his
grace
would
not
have
varied
without
he
had
been
persuaded
to
the
contrary

Written
this
day
of
March

Whereupon
Sir
I
put
my
lord
of
Suffolk
in
choice
whether
he
would
accomplish
the
marriage
within
four
days
or
else
that
he
should
never
have
enjoyed
me
whereby
I
know
well
that
I
constrained
him
to
break
such
promises
as
he
made
your
grace
as
well
for
fear
of
losing
of
me
as
also
that
I
ascertained
him
that
by
their
consent
I
would
never
come
into
England

Beseeching
you
my
Lord
at
mine
instance
and
for
my
sake
to
be
so
good
Lord
unto
my
servant
John
Palgrave
master
of
art
which
has
done
unto
me
right
good
and
acceptable
service
to
his
and
his
friends'
great
charge
and
on
my
part
as
yet
hitherto
unremembered
as
by
your
good
wisdom
and
provision
to
find
the
means
that
he
may
have
one
of
the
said
benefices

Unto
my
dearest
brother
the
King's
Grace

Yours
MARGARET
R.
To
my
Lord
Cardinal

And
the
gentlemen
which
must
take
pain
to
levy
this
money
amongst
the
King’s
subjects
I
think
shallhave
no
little
business
about
the
same

Out
of
Spain
we
have
news
that
there
is
a
truce
or
abstinence
of
war
taken
between
the emperor
and
them
of
France

For
his
Grace
thinks
it
a
great
hindrance
to
the
come
affairs
that
the Emperor
should
grant
any
such
safe conduct
whereby
there
should
be
any
mutual
intercourse
between
his
subjects
and
their
common
enemies
and
the
commodities
of
France
having
vent
and
utterance
the enemy
thereby
the
better
furnished
of
money
should
be
the
more
able
the
longer
to
maintain
the
war

And
now
he
says
he
is
servant
unto
the Emperors
Majesty
and
is
going
in
to
Spain
with
letters
to
him
and
indeed
he
has
diverse
letters
to
his
Majesty
and
so
was
it
easy
for
him
to
get
if
he
intended
to
deceive
and
mock
as
the
King’s
Grace
thinks
that
he
does

All
which
letters
and
copies
I
have
distinctly
read
unto
his
Grace

And
thus
our
Lord
long
preserve
your
good
Grace
in
honour
and
health

From
Oxford
the
27th
day
of
June

That
you
will
so
specially
tender
me
in
this
behalf
as
to
inform
the
King’s
Highness
of
these
premises
whereby
I
may
the
more
tenderly
be
regarded
of
his
gracious
person
your
word
in
this
shall
be
to
me
a
sure
help
and
God
shall
be
to
you
therefore
a
sure
reward
which
does
promise
good
to
them
that
does
help
poor
forsaken
widows

Wherefore
I
purpose
if
it
shall
so
stand
with
the
King’s
pleasure
whereof
I
pray
you
I
may
be
advertised
by
your
next
letters
after
the
French
King’s
commission
shall be
here
arrived
if
they
vehemently
press
me
to
begin
to
common
with
them
upon
the
King’s
said
entree
for
the
avoiding
of
the
said
suspicion

I
send
unto
the
King’s
Highness
by
my
Lord
of
Exeter
bearer
hereof
certain
of
the
Crowns
of
the
Rose
as
be
newly
struck
and
coined
in
the
King’s
Mint
which
be
of
like
finesse
and
poise
as
the
Crown
Soleil
and
as
you
do
know
the
same
be
proclaimed
to
be
current
after
the
rate
of
4
s
6
d.
apiece

After
my
most
humble
recommendations
Where
as
I
understand
by
the
rapport
of
diverse
such
as
be
my
friends
that
you
be
towards
me
now
as
you
have
been
ever
my
especially
good
master
I
do
therefore
most
humbly
thank
you
beseeching
you
of
your
good
continuance
and
whereas
I
for
your
sundry
benefits
used
unto
me
esteem
my
self
more
bound
to
you
than
to
any
one
man
living
which
hitherto
I
have
had
never
other
ability
to
recompense
but
only
by
my
word
to
declare
it
where
I
have
seen
time
and
place
convenient

Never
shall
there
any
loss
in
this
matter
grieve
me
being
my
self
so
innocent
as
grace
and
I
know
by
the
grace
of
Almighty
God
who
both
bodily
and
ghostly
preserve
you

Master
Cromwell
has
assigned
her
to
the
King's
attorney
for
writings
that
should
be
made
and
he
drives
her
off
that
she
makes
as
much
suit
to
him
now
as
she
did
to
Master
Cromwell

For
in
this
matter
of
the
Nun
of
Canterbury
I
have
unto
your
trusty
Counsellor
master
Thomas
Cromwell
by
my
writing
as
plainly
declared
the
truth
as
*
I
possibly
*
can
which
my
declaration
*
as
I
understand
*
is
made
known
to
your
noble
Grace

Therefore
shall
you
understand
that
on
Friday
last
the
30th
of
April
in
the
afternoon
master
Lieutenant
showd
me
that
Master
Secretary
would
speak
with
me

Whereunto
master
Secretary
answered
that
he
thought
that
this
manner
of
answer
would
not
satisfy
the
King’s
Highness
for
that
his
Grace
expected
a
more
full
answer
and
that
to
the
purpose

I
do
no
body
any
harm
I
say
no
harm
I
think
no
harm
I
wish
every
body
well
I
pray
for
them

My
Lord
whereas
you
charge
me
with
promise
written
with
mine
one
hand
to
change
the
two
years
into
two
months
I
think
you
have
no
such
plain
sentence
written
with
my
hand
I
know
not
whether
you
be
paraphrased
or
not
if
you
be
learned
in
that
science
it
is
possible
you
may
of
one
word
make
a
hole
sentence
and
yet
not
at
all
times
after
the
true
meaning
of
the
writer
as
it
appears
by
this
your
exposition
upon
my
writing

Wherever
of
this
I
shall
beseech
you
to
be
persuaded
ever
surely
to
have
in
me
such
a
heart
and
stomach
as
is
convenient
to
be
in
him
who
to
you
of
all
other
shall
be
most
bound

Sir
as
you
know
since
our
first
acquaintance
and
familiarity
many
letters
there
has
been
at
sundry
times
between
us
written
and
much
communication
there
has
been
also
concerning
the
institution
of
our
lives
with
such
fidelity
ministered
upon
both
parties
as
was
convenient
to
the
sincereness
of
our
hearts
and
minds
but
if
ever
any
of
these
you
have
judged
to
be
worthy
of
remembrance
or
yet
do
stick
in
your
memory
and
mind
I
beseech

this

sir
I
will
make
an
end

my

comfortable
news

all
such

fame
which
by
men
of
corrupt
judgement
not
having
discretion
to
judge
and
discern
between
very
and
true
religion
and
light
and
false
superstition
since
was
in
Italy
you
divulged

utterly
false

vanity

Written
in
haste

To
my
welbeloved
sister
Mary

And
thus
as
one
desirous
to
hire
of
your
Majesty’s
health
thought
unfortunate
to
see
it
I
shall
pray
God
for
ever
to
preserve
you

And
thus
I
will
(
troubling
your
Majesty
I
fear
end
with
my
most
humble
thanks

And
now
I
beseech
your
Highness
to
give
me
leave
to
write
what
I
think
touching
your
Majesty’s
letters

Therefore
I
desire
you
as
my
trust
is
that
you
will
be
so
good
aunt
to
him

And
for
the
testimony
hereof
to
the
satisfaction
of
such
as
shall
conceive
any
doubt
herein
We
understand
that
certain
of
our
nobility
have
written
at
this
present
in
some
part
to
admonish
you
of
your
duties
and
to
testify
their
knowledge
of
the
truth
of
our
title
and
right

Which
I
pray
God
be
taken
no
other
ways
that
it
is
meant

And
albeit
we
be
not
of
mind
to
praise
our
said
good
Sister
further
than
shall
come
of
her
own
good
pleasure
to
put
that
matter
in
question

and
for
your
self
we
cannot
but
let
you
know
that
we
hear
out
of
France
such
singular
good
reports
of
your
duty
well
accomplished
towards
your
husband
both
living
and
dead
with
other
your
sober
wise
and
discreet
behaviour
in
that
court
and
country
that
we
think
it
a
part
of
great
contentation
to
us
and
commendation
of
our
country
that
such
a
gentlewoman
has
given
so
manifest
a
testimony
of
virtue
in
such
hard
times
of
adversity

Now
Madame
I
have
promised
you
to
come
to
you
and
having
there
made
my
moan
and
complaint
of
those
rebels
and
they
coming
thither
not
as
possessors
but
as
subjects
to
answer
I
would
have
besought
you
to
hear
my
justification
of
that
which
they
have
falsely
set
forth
against
me
and
if
I
could
not
purge
myself
thereof
you
might
then
discharge
your
hands
of
my
causes
and
let
me
go
for
such
as
I
am

Happen
what
may
happen
I
have
as
lief
to
abide
my
fortune
as
to
seek
it
and
not
find
it

In
that
you
trust
me
I
will
not
(
to
die
for
it
deceive
you
but
from
Donbertran
I
answer
not
when
my
L.
Flemyn
shall be
in
the
Tower
for
they
which
are
within
it
will
not
let

receive
succours
if
I
do
not
assure
them
of
yours

to

queen

me

I
can
persuade
you
namely
in
this
language
excuse
my
evil
writing

I
never
used
it
before

The

for

I
therefore
desire
you
to

me
at
this
present
with
40
pounds
to
supply
me
necessary
wants

I
bid
you
farewell
this
16th
of
October
1583

I
hope
you
more
esteem
your
honour
than
to
give
it
such
a
stain
since
you
have
protested
so
often
to
have
taken
these
Lords
for
your
most
affectionate
subjects
and
to
have
done
all
for
your
best

Mr.
Broughton
I
forgot
in
my
letters
to
write
for
Mr.
Aldersey's
bills
to
be
sent
over
in
haste
by
Merick

I
am
sure
there
be
a
100
of
these
already
delivered
and
the
rest
will be
before
I
can
revoke
them
having
appointed
the
18th
and
20th
of
the
next
month
for
their
repair
hither
with
all
their
furniture

Whereupon
this
sudden
change
does
grow
Mr
secretary
I
can
not
imagine
neither
will
I
meddle
withal
but
must
obey
her
Majesty’s
pleasure
if
she
have
determined
any
alteration
which
I
desire
to
hear
from
you
for
if
I
come
to
the
court
it
must
more
easily
break
out
as
it
will
notwithstanding
and
I
can
but
grief
at
the
miserable
estate
of
the
poor
afflicted
as
for
my
own
it
must
be
as
the
potters
vessel
etc.

I
trust
my
good
Lord
now
that
I
have
taken
this
voyage
upon
me
to
serve
her
Majesty
as
she
has
commanded
your
Lordship
will
be
mindful
of
me
poor
man
but
of
the
cause
committed
now
to
my
delinge
chiefly

My
Lord
no
man
feels
comfort
but
they
that
have
cause
of
grief
and
no
men
have
so
much
need
of
relief
and
comfort
as
those
that
go
in
these
doubtful
services

They
so
shook
him
up
and
with
such
terms
naming
her
Majesty
in
scorn
as
they
took
it
as
they
hurled
him
his
letters
and
bid
him
content
himself
they
would
first
discharge
all
the
least
duties
whatsoever
to
her
majesty
before
they
would
hear
him

God
send
her
Majesty
to
think
of
his
merciful
dealings
accordingly

Some
her
Majesty
did
set
down
as
I
take
it
above
70000
pounds

Thus
referring
you
for
the
rest
to
Mr.
Davyson
at
his
coming
I
will
take
my
leave
protesting
my
whole
care
and
endeavour
his
to
do
her
Majesty
acceptable
service
or
else
God
not
to
let
me
live
if
otherwise
it
should
be

The
circumstance
it
may
please
you
to
have
of
this
bearer

And
Mr.
Quarles
has
sent
down
divers
supplies
more
than
allowance
for
the
numbers
were
great
before
we
entered
into
the
six
weeks'
victuals

It
might
have
bred
some
mischief
but
it
was
quickly
put
out

My
Lord
on
Wednesday
last
I
went
to
Harwich
to
see
the
town
and
the
haven
which
I
had
not
seen
this
27
years

My
good
Lord
God
send
you
ever
well
to
do
and
so
I
bid
your
Lordship
most
heartily
farewell

I
would
fain
keep
the
Narrow
Seas
three
or
four
months
I
persuade
myself
I
shall
do
some
service

If
it
were
not
for
you
I
should
live
in
a
dead
place
for
hearing
of
anything

I
will
have
a
watch
on
them

Sir
I
had
forgotten
in
my
last
letter
to
answer
the
matter
you
did
write
in
touching
Captain
Morgan
my
man

I
do
assure
you
they
live
here
bountifully
and
it
will
be
hard
finding
of
such
noblemen
as
these
be
so
well
affected
to
this
service
and
that
will
love
the
sea
so
well
as
they
do

My
honourable
and
good
Lord
I
have
received
your
letter
even
as
I
was
weighing
to
go
out
and
for
the
first
part
I
am
most
heartily
to
give
your
Lordship
thanks
for
your
honourable
favour

And
so
my
Lord
having
no
more
leisure
to
write
at
large
being
under
sail
I
bid
your
Lordship
most
heartily
farewell

If
your
Majesty
thought
it
meet
it
would
not
be
amiss
you
sent
presently
to
Denmark
to
understand
the
truth
and
to
deal
with
their
King
according
to
your
Majesty's
great
wisdom

Thirdly
at
Calais
by
fire
we
forced
them
to
cut
many
of
their
cables
whereby
they
lost
many
of
their
anchors
which
of
necessity
they
must
seek
to
supply

The
winter
will
overtake
them
else
in
those
parts

For
that
we
were
very
near
to
set
sail
I
most
humbly
beseech
your
Honour
to
pardon
my
pen
for
that
I
am
forced
to
write
the
very
copy
of
that
letter
which
I
have
sent
to
my
Lord
Chancellor

Your
Honour's
faithfully
to
be
commanded
FRANCIS
DRAKE

And
yet
with
my
consent
we
ought
much
more
to
have
regard
unto
the
Duke
of
Parma
and
his
soldiers
than
to
the
Duke
of
Siding
and
his
ships
for
that
our
sands
will
take
a
strong
party
with
us
against
his
great
ships
under
water

I
think
it
one
of
the
best
services
we
can
have
in
hand

should
now
give
glory
unto
his
greatness
for
penetrating
in
his
power
his
hand
lies
heavy
upon
me
he
has
spoken
unto
me
with
a
voice
of
thunder
and
I
have
felt
he
is
a
God
that
can
punish
enemies

With
you
I
join
young
Juvenal
that
biting
satirist
that
lastly
with
me
together
writ
a
comedy

For
other
new
comers
I
leave
them
to
the
mercy
of
these
painted
monsters
who
I
doubt
not
will
drive
the
bestminded
to
despise
them
for
the
rest
it
skills
not
though
they
make
a
ieast
at
them

Desirous
that
you
should
live
though
himself
be
dying
ROBERT
GREEENE

Thus
God
has
cast
me
down
that
I
might
be
humbled
and
punished
me
for
example
of
others’
sin
and
although
he
suffers
me
in
this
world
to
perish
without
succour
yet
trust
I
in
the
world
to
come
to
find
mercy
by
the
merits
of
my
Saviour
to
whom
I
commend
you
and
commit

soul

No
no
fair
witty
and
worthy
mistress
I
have
too
long
deceived
myself
because
when
I
was
with
you
my
heart
was
so
fixed
upon
you
that
I
could
not
look
into
myself
now
I
come
to
pose
my
disordered
study
from
that
survey
I
came
to
behold
my
distempered
self
I
find
neither
nobleness
nor
richness
nor
government
nor
knowledge
nor
eloquence
nor
comeliness
nor
any
thing
love
worthy
in
me
for
my
wealth
you
may
disdain
me
for
my
behaviour
you
may
shun
me
for
my
wit
you
may
laugh
at
me
for
my
speech
you
may
reprehend
me
for
my
letters
you
may
be
weary
of
me
and
for
my
face
you
may
most
justly
hate
me

J:H
SIR
Although
the
answer
I
received
from
you
two
days
since
gave
my
small
encouragement
to
flatter
myself
that
any
importunity
I
could
make
should
be
able
to
appease
the
scandal
you
had
conceived
to
be
given
you
by
my
unfortunate
husband
yet
had
it
not
pleased
God
to
power
upon
me
one
affliction
after
an
other
and
to
add
to
the
immeasurable
sorrows
of
my
heart
so
violent
a
sickness
as
I
am
not
able
of
myself
to
stir
out
of
my
bed
I
had
presented
unto
your
view
the
image
of
the
importunate
widow
mentioned
in
the
Scripture
and
had
never
ceased
to
pester
you
with
my
complains
till
you
had
afforded
me
some
assurance
that
whatsoever
respects
might
dehorte
you
from
so
much
as
wishing
my
husband's
good
yet
that
an
afflicted
and
woeful
lady
should
not
wholly
loose
her
labour
or
return
desperate
of
such
comforts
at
the
last
year
you
so
honourably
ministered
unto
me
in
a
great
affliction
though
differing
from
this
in
quality

Losses
of
men
somewhat
equal
but
the

has
recovered

"
Your
true
certain
friend
"
John
Donne

Most
truly
honourable
/
it
has
still
been
the
tyranny
of
my
fortune
so
to
oppress
my
endeavours
that
before
I
can
show
my
self
grateful
(
in
the
least
for
former
benefits
I
am
enforced
to
provoke
your
bounties
for
more

If
I
have
been
misreported
to
his
Majesty
the
punishment
I
now
suffer
may
I
hope
merit
more
of
his
princely
favour
when
he
shall
know
me
truly
eerie
accusation
does
not
condemn

The
noble
favours
you
have
done
us
most
worthy
Lord
can
not
be
so
concealed
or
removed
but
that
they
have
broke
in
upon
us
even
where
we
lye
double
bound
to
their
comforts
nor
can
we
doubt
but
he
who
has
so
far
and
freely
adventured
to
the
relief
of
our
virtue
will
go
on
to
the
utmost
release
of
it
and
though
I
know
your
Lordship
has
been
far
from
doing
any
thing
herein
to
your
own
ambition
yet
be
pleased
to
take
this
protestation
that
(
next
his
Majesty’s
favour
I
shall
not
covet
that
thing
more
in
the
world
than
to
express
the
lasting
gratitude
I
have
conceived
in
soul
towards
your
Lordship

And
though
we
know
it
only
the
property
of
men
guilty
and
worthy
of
punishment
to
invoke
mercy
yet
now
it
might
relieve
us
who
have
only
our
fortunes
made
our
fault
and
are
indeed
vexed
for
other
men’s
licences

And
so
much
I
have
sent
to
some
of
them

But
remember
that
nothing
is
flattery
which
the
speaker
believes
and
of
the
grossest
flattery
there
is
this
good
use
that
they
tell
us
what
we
should
be

Of
which
since
I
have
been
a
witness
and
subject
not
to
tell
you
sometimes
that
by
your
influence
and
example
I
have
attained
to
such
a
step
of
goodness
as
to
be
thankful

loth
to
accuse

it

Sir
I
sat
up
last
night
till
past
12
to
write
out
this
sheet
and
had
not
necessity

I
cannot

know

desire
to
make
you
part
of
amends
for
your
great
friendship
to
me

my
labour

could

the
last
scene
which
that
you
may
see
finished
I
send
you
the

sheet

I
was
writing

SIR,—If
my
business
had
not
been
much
and
my
stay
at
Redgrave
very
little
I
had
purposed
to
have
seen
you
at
Palgrave

I
am
sorry
that
your
business
does
carry
you
another
way
that
I
shall
not
see

end

to
deserve
by
any
office

THIS
day
I
could
not
meet
you
because
the
rest
of

company
could
not
be
there
and
tomorrow
my
Lady
of
Roxborough's
business
whom
I
must
not
forsake
will
pass
a
trial
so
as
I
can
neither
go
my
journey
nor
hope
to
see
you
if
you
go
away
on
Wednesday
before
your
return
into
the
country
which
I
am
extreme
sorry
for
but
I
will
in
the
morning
send
to
you
again
either
my
farewell
or
to
receive
the
good
news
that
you
go
not
so
soon
which
if
you
do
not
I
will
God
willing
come
to
you
on
Wednesday
till
when
I
kiss
your
hands

To
my
dear
and
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis

This
dull
town
affords
nothing
worthy
the
writing
for
there
is
almost
nobody
of
quality
left
in
it

Harington
House
this
26th
of
May
1617

Some
other
time
I
hope
will
be
more
fortunate
to
me
than
this
any
way
is
and
none
shall
I
esteem
more
so
than
that
which
may
bring
forth
an
opportunity
for
me
to
testify
the
unfeignedness
of
that
respect
has
so
often
been
vowed
unto
you
by
your
most
affectionate
and
faithful
friend
LADY
BEDFORD
Huntingdon
this
11th
of
April
1618

If
any
copies
of
them
be
desired
I
will
return
such
as
he
must
extraordinarily
well
know
paintings
that
shall
distinguish
them
from
the
originals

Even
at
such
a
time
as
I
could
not
be
pleased
with
any
meat
to
please
my
stomach
notwithstanding
I
was
sick
of
a
chicken
yesternight
yet
I
could
eat
this
with
desire
and
yet
not
sick
of
it
but
my
fits
never
of
me

To
my
loving
honourable
sister
the
Lady
Cornwallis
give
these

I
send
this
messenger
to
bring
me
word
how
you
Mister
Bacon
and
all
your
little
ones
do
and
by
him
send
my
servant
Fred
a
sword
to
defend
him
from
the
malice
of
the
bucks
in
this
their
choleric
season

To
my
noble
and
worthy
friend
the
Lady
Cornwallis
at
Broome

And
so
Sir
wishing
us
the
continuance
of
blessed
peace
at
home
I
humbly
rest
at
your
commandments

WOTTON

I
am
sure
you
believe
there
are
not
many
for
whom
I
durst
engage
my
word
to
you
so
freely
and
therefore
will
easily
judge
that
I
offer
you
the
service
but
of
two
but
if
those
two
give
you
not
a
good
account
of
what
I
promise
in
their
names
set
it
on
my
score
as
a
falsehood

Bedford
House
in
haste
this
Thursday
morning
April
1619

My
sister
desires
to
be
remembered
to
you
and
my
brother
not
forgetting
my
little
nephew

And
for
the
rest
philosophy
shall
be
my
reward
which
though
it
cannot
keep
me
from
need
yet
it
will
teach
me
not
to
envy
those
that
abound

Right
honourable
This
is
only
to
signify
unto
his
Majesty
that
by
God's
favour
within
two
or
three
days
after
the
date
thereof
we
shall
depart
from
hence
so
as
my
next
will
be
from
Augusta
where
there
is
as
you
know
a
feat
to
be
done
for
which
the
party
is
well
prepared

Yet
God
that
sees
no
affliction
to
work
sufficiently
upon
me
has
this
last
night
added
another
heavy
one
to
my
former
woe
having
taken
my
Lord
Chamberlain's
son

DEAR
CORNWALLIS
I
KNOW
that
by
this
time
I
have
deserved
and
undergone
much
of
your
censure
if
I
have
not
lost
all
your
favour
which
to
redeem
I
do
protest
unto
you
that
the
only
cause
you
have
been
so
long
without
hearing
from
me
was
that
I
was
ashamed
to
send
till
I
could
return
you
that
part
of
your
wealth
you
have
so
long
been
pleased
to
trust
me
with
to
whom
alone
I
had
been
beholding
for
a
courtesy
of
this
nature

For
the
first
I
assure
you
your
new
nephew
is
as
fine
and
towardly
a
youth
as
any
I
know
and
for
the
other
my
Lord
Hamilton
my
Lord
Chamberlain
and
my
Lord
of
Montgomery
have
done
their
best
and
will
do
still
to
keep
off
all
the
blows
they
can
others'
malice
aims
at
her
but
what
the
success
will
be
I
dare
not
promise
so
strongly
is
the
King
incensed
and
so
bitter
yet
in
the
prosecution
but
I
will
assure
you
if
there
were
no
other
ground
but
that
of
her
blood
it
shall
make
me
keep
warmest
in
my
friend’s
desires
to
save
her
from
public
shame
and
I
beseech
you
since
your
own
virtue
exempts
you
from
all
reproach
in
her
be
so
just
to
yourself
as
not
to
be
afflicted
with
her
danger

This
done
I
intend
to
turn
Combe
wholly
into
money
both
to
make
myself
a
free
woman
from
debt
and
with
the
rest
of
it
to
raise
as
good
an
estate
for
life
as
I
can
having
now
none
but
myself
to
provide
for
those
designs
I
had
for
my
niece
being
crossed
by
her
father's
untowardness
and
her
own
portion
being
sufficient
for
any
match

Do
me
the
favour
to
recommend
me
affectionately
to
Mister
Bacon
and
thank
him
for
his
kind
remembering
me

Therefore
dear
Cornwallis
let
not
this
melancholy
prevail
with
you
to
the
begetting
or
nourishing
of
those
mistrusts
will
turn
more
to
your
hurt
than
that
you
fear
which
I
hope
will
pass
with
safety
and
end
to
your
comfort
unto
which
if
I
could
tell
how
here
or
there
to
advise
anything
I
would
affectionately
endeavour
at
in
absence
and
readily
undertake
a
longer
journey
to
you
than
it
is
to
Broome
for
though
I
have
long
suffered
under
a
condition
has
maimed
me
of
all
means
in
real
effects
to
express
it
and
has
almost
made
me
hate
fruitless
professions
yet
there
is
no
friend
more
sensible
of
what
they
owe
to
another
nor
fuller
of
earnest
desires
to
deserve
well
of
them
than
my
heart
can
witness
I
am
towards
you
to
whom
I
am
not
in
so
much
despair
of
making
it
appear
as
I
have
been
nor
I
hope
are
you
less
confident
that
it
is
an
unfeigned
truth
that
I
am
Your
most
affectionately
faithful
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

Therefore
again
I
pray
you
to
resolve
to
change
place
for
a
while
some
divertissements
at
the
least
you
will
find
here
from
whence
I
shall
not
I
think
remove
till
after
Midsummer
term

My
Lord
of
Buckingham
has
made
his
declaration
to
the
parliament
who
yet
applaud
it
because
it
tends
to
the
final
breach
of
the
match
with
Spain

I
presented
him
with
your
casket
which
in
respect
it
was
yours
I
could
hardly
fasten
upon
him
had
not
Mister
Short
witnessed
that
it
was
before
set
apart
for
him

Harington
House
this
23rd
of
June
1624

Dear
Madam
return
my
thanks
and
affectionate
salutations
to
your
husband
and
believe
that
though
it
will
be
with
a
sadder
heart
I
shall
ever
continue
to
love
you
as
your
kindness
has
from
time
to
time
given
me
cause
which
is
all
so
unfortunate
a
woman
as
I
am
can
deserve
it
by
but
of
that
you
shall
never
want
any
real
proof
can
be
given
by
Your
most
affectionate
and
thankful
friend
LADY
BEDFORD

Since
your
going
my
Lord
of
Kensington
is
come
out
of
France
who
brings
word
that
they
are
so
desirous
of
that
match
as
I
believe
it
will
presently
be
both
concluded
and
she
here
ere
long
upon
less
ill
conditions
than
Spain
insisted
on
for
matter
of
religion

The
King
is
pleased
to
use
my
Lord
Chamberlain
that
is
as
graciously
as
any
man
which
gives
many
much
confidence
seeing
the
King
so
well
inclined
to
favour
honest
men
which
he
is
known
to
be
and
one
that
will
never
abuse
his
trust

But
now
I
have
many
reasons
to
assure
myself
he
expected
not
to
live
out
this
year
though
he
was
sparing
to
utter
that
to
those
he
knew
loved
him
best
for
grieving
them
yet
now
I
call
to
mind
many
speeches
of
his
I
heeded
not
when
they
were
spoken
might
have
made
me
take
more
hold
what
his
opinion
was
of
his
short
continuance
on
earth
where
he
has
not
left
such
another
nor
any
creature
so
great
a
loser
as
I
in
the
death
of
a
friend
whom
if
it
had
pleased
God
to
have
longer
spared
us
would
at
this
time
both
to
the
public
and
his
private
friends
have
been
that
we
must
not
look
to
see
any
other

Thus
with
the
remembrance
of
my
never
enough
acknowledged
love
and
service
to
you
I
rest
your
most
faithful
friend
and
humble
servant

The
King’s
funeral
sermon
is
come
forth
wherein
the
Lord
Keeper
has
showed
a
great
deal
of
wit
and
learning
in
comparing
King
James
to
King
Salomon
in
all
his
actions
saving
his
vices

From
London
this
21st
of
May
1625

The
French
king
promises
to
overtake
her
at
Amiens
and
there
take
his
leave
but
the
Queen
regnant
and
Queen
mother
accompany
her
to
the
seaside
so
that
we
are
like
to
have
three
Queens
at
Bullen
to
answer
the
three
kings
of
Cullen

Young
Master
Fanshaw
recommends
this
letter
to
his
brother
if
he
may
be
found
for
it
seems
he
obscures
himself
and
would
not
that
any
of
his
friends
should
know
what
becomes
of
him
nor
what
course
he
means
to
take
or
under
what
captain
colonel
or
general
he
has
put
himself
that
they
may
know
how
to
hear
of
him
If
you
can
learn
by
any
that
come
from
the
army
or
by
any
other
means
what
he
does
it
will be
held
for
a
great
favour
from
your
Lordship

My
hope
is
to
see
you
here
this
day
sevennight
or
tomorrow
sevennight
and
I
pray
God
give
us
a
happy
meeting
and
preserve
you
safe
which
will
be
the
great
comfort
of
Your
most
true
affectionate
wife
BRILLIANA
HARLEY

I
assure
myself
I
have
your
prayers
because
you
have
so
great
a
part
of
mine
and
I
bless
God
that
you
enjoy
your
health
which
I
beg
of
you
to
take
care
of

In
the
meantime
my
Lord
Marshall
remains
at
the
Tower
though
my
Lord
Chamberlain
is
labouring
to
get
his
prison
changed
to
his
own
house
at
Highgate

To
my
dear
husband
Sir
Robert
Harley

I
send
it
up
now
because
I
think
carriage
when
it
is
ready
to
drink
does
it
hurt
therefore
and
please
you
to
let
it
rest
and
than
taste
it
if
it
is
good
I
pray
you
let
my
father
have
it
because
he
spoke
to
me
for
such
meat

If
you
think
it
will
not
displease
him
and
it
may
anything
at
all
set
forward
your
business
I
pray
you
deliver
it
to
him

He
begins
now
to
delight
in
reading
and
that
is
the
book
I
would
have
him
place
his
delight
in

I
give
you
many
thanks
for
this
your
desire
which
you
favour
me
with
all
in
letting
me
hear
of
my
nephew's
good
health
which
I
am
very
glad
of

Your
Ladyship’s
to
be
commanded
BRIDGET
LONG

Sir
William
Plaiter
will
acquaint
you
with
the
business
of
my
Lord
Banning's
daughters
which
we
think
very
good
marriages
and
not
hard
to
be
gotten
by
you
because
you
have
a
great
many
friends
to
make
way
for
you
as
my
Lord
of
Dorset
and
Sir
Henry
German
that
are
near
kinsmen
to
them

I
spoke
with
Mister
Chitting
about
Sir
Thomas
Barrington’s
niece
he
seems
to
think
she
is
worth
seven
thousand
pounds
but
he
will
write
to
you
the
particulars

Sir
William
Plaiters
is
in
this
town
and
has
been
ever
since
he
came
from
you
but
he
has
been
ill
of
late
with
sore
eyes

So
I
altogether
concealed
our
name
and
urged
no
further
because
we
have
little
reason
to
undervalue
ourselves
so
much
as
to
importune
that
which
so
much
deserves
to
be
met
at
least
half
way
in

I
hope
a
better
will
come
in
your
way
in
the
meantime
and
if
a
good
offer
comes
I
presume
you
will
not
delay
it
for
it
is
hard
to
meet
with
one
whose
person
and
portion
is
without
exception

My
mother
is
very
ill
with
the
gout
I
am
afraid
I
shall
not
enjoy
her
long

TO
OUR
TRUSTY
AND
RIGHT
WELL
BELOVED
THE
LADY
BACON

If
we
can
prevail
but
this
much
further
with
you
that
you
will
extend
the
same
kindness
towards
your
daughter
in
law
and
so
receive
them
both
into
your
motherly
care
you
shall
put
such
an
obligation
upon
us
as
we
shall
never
forget
but
remember
upon
all
occasions
wherein
our
favour
can
be
of
any
use
unto
you
and
with
this
assurance
we
commit
you
to
the
protection
of
the
Almighty

I
cannot
but
hope
to
see
you
at
London
shortly
where
I
fear
I
shall
be
enforced
to
stay
till
the
end
of
next
term
to
see
if
I
can
bring
my
mother's
business
to
something
for
yet
we
have
done
little
by
reason
my
Lady
Weston
was
out
of
town
and
so
could
never
come
to
have
my
Lord
and
she
together

My
cousin
Peter
Meautys
has
your
letters
and
a
copy
of
the
paper
you
sent
he
stays
but
for
a
wind

For
the
money
when
she
could
get
it
you
should
have
it
and
if
in
the
meantime
the
King
and
Queen's
promise
from
their
own
mouths
to
you
will
any
way
give
you
content
she
will
not
fail
to
procure
that
and
she
desired
me
to
write
you
word
so
which
I
made
answer
it
was
better
for
her
to
write
it
herself

ACCORDING
to
my
promise
I
will
not
fail
to
let
you
understand
of
my
proceedings
last
week
which
was
the
first
opportunity
I
could
get
to
come
unto
the
speech
of
my
Lord
of
Dorset
who
was
pleased
to
tell
me
how
much
his
Lordship
had
travelled
in
Mister
Meautys's
behalf
to
his
Majesty
for
the
making
of
a
baronet
the
which
his
Majesty
will
by
no
means
grant
so
for
that
I
am
already
answered

Were
it
that
I
did
know
how
to
help
myself
I
would
not
bespeak
one
hour's
time
that
you
have
prefixed
but
now
I
hope
that
you
will
take
me
into
your
consideration

To
my
dear
and
much
honoured
sister
Lady
Bacon

For
my
dear
husband
Sir
Robert
Harley
Knight

She
was

my
old
lady
Manering

I
thank
you
for
my
very
fine
waistcoat

this
carrier

DEAR
MOTHER
I
HAD
last
Saturday
brought
me
by
a
Londoner
a
bill
of
exchange
as
they
call
it
for
two
hundred
pounds
presently
to
be
paid
to
the
bearer
thereof
because
he
had
already
had
the
money

Here
is
much
talking
of
foreign
wars
and
armies
joining
yet
no
certainty
but
I
humbly
beseech
God
keep
our
Fred
from
amongst
them
and
all
harm

Recommend
my
hearty
love
to
Mr.
Busse
Mr.
Beadly
and
my
other
good
friends

But
when
I
think
how
troublesome
I
have
been
and
how
unpleasing
company
I
must
yet
be
to
everybody
I
recall
my
wishes
and
hope
that
God
will
give
me
that
happiness
when
I
shall
be
more
capable
of
it
than
now
I
could
being
so
often
ill
but
Madam
if
I
do
think
of
anything
that
my
stomach
will
serve
me
to
eat
I
will
make
such
use
of
your
kind
favour
for
which
I
humbly
thank
your
Ladyship
that
you
shall
be
sure
to
hear
of
me

send
me

my

your

If
you
want
anything
let
me
know
it

Bromton
Nov.

1638

I
heard
that
there
was
a
cardinal’s
cape
brought
to
the
custom
house
valued
at
a
high
rate
but
none
would
own
it
and
to
requite
your
intelligence
I
let
you
know
what
I
hear

My
dear
Ned
you
may
see
how
willing
I
am
to
discourse
with
you
that
have
spun
out
my
letter
to
this
length

Truly
than
this
I
find
that
He
gives
springs
in
a
dry
barren
wilderness
where
no
water
is

One
beam
in
a
dark
place
has
exceeding
much
refreshment
in
it
blessed
be
His
name
for
shining
upon
so
dark
a
heart
as
mine

Salute
your
husband
and
sister
from
me
he
is
not
a
man
of
his
word

The
subject
of
it
is
to
make
a
Declaration
against
the
orders
of
Parliament
which
are
made
without
the
king

The
Q
for
me
to
signify
to
Lord
Chamberlain

My
dear
sister
the
Lady
Bacon
at
Culford
these

If
you
do
I
must
be
pardoned
what
my
relation
to
the
public
calls
for

To
my
honoured
friends
the
Deputy
Lieutenants
for
the
County
of
Suffolk

Gentlemen
command
Your
servant
OLIVER
CROMWELL

I
beseech
you
therefore
consider
this
gentleman
and
the
soldiers
and
if
it
be
possible
make
up
his
company
a
hundred-and-twenty
and
send
them
away
with
what
expedition
is
possible

Some
time
they
must
have
for
exercise

I
protest
if
it
were
for
myself
I
would
not
move
you

I
am
neglected
exceedingly

My
estate
is
little

He
has
not
one
able
to
put
on
'that
business.'
The
force
will
fall
if
some
help
not

But
we
got
to
horse
and
retreated
in
good
order
with
the
safety
of
all
our
horse
of
the
association
not
losing
four
of
them
that
I
hear
of
and
we
got
five
of
theirs

The
horses
that
his
coronet
Boulry
took
he
will
put
himself
upon
that
issue
for
them
all

Let
them
therefore
if
I
be
thought
worthy
of
any
favour
leave
your
country
with
your
good
wishes
and
a
blessing

Not
that
I
would
for
ten
thousand
horses
have
the
horse
to
my
own
private
benefit
saving
to
make
use
of
him
for
the
public
for
I
will
most
gladly
return
the
value
of
him
to
the
state

Admit
he
be
shall
that
render
him
incapable
to
serve
the
public

If
there
be
any
other
offence
to
be
charged
upon
him
that
must
in
a
judicial
way
receive
determination

This
is
all
but
that
I
am
ready
to
serve
you
and
rest
Your
loving
friend
OLIVER
CROMWELL

I
have
offered
him
now
another
place
of
meeting
to
come
to
which
I
suppose
he
will
not
deny
me
and
that
to
be
tomorrow

Sir
I
have
a
great
desire
to
shift
my
residence
a
while
and
to
live
a
month

in
Norwich
by
you
where
I
may
have
the
happiness
of
your

I
have
taken
the
boldness
to
write
the
same
by
my
Lord
Gerard
to
the
King
who
I
believe
will
be
with
you
as
soon
as
this
letter
for
he
went
from
hence
upon
Saturday
last

I
pray
tell
my
Lady
Hide
I
am
very
glad
she
is
so
well
come
to
Cologne

There
is
little
news
here
the
King
of
Sweden
has
born
a
son
to
him
and
has
and
prospers
exceedingly

She
sent
another
account
than
that
to
the
Ambassador
as
you
may
imagine
but
the
landgrave
wrote
the
truth
to
his
niece

Mr.
Secretary
I
thank
you
both
for
the
good
news
you
write
to
Sir
Charles
Cottrell
out
of
Holland
and
for
your
letter
I
received
this
morning
with
the
relation
of
the
defeat
before
Arras

Indorsed
7th
of
September
1654

Their
agent
in
Sueden
write
to
the
States
General
that
Sir
George
Fleetwood
brother
to
him
that
is
Lieutenant
of
Ireland
told
him
that
he
knew
Cromwell
had
said
he
would
keep
the
peace
with
the
States
no
longer
then
he
found
it
good
for
his
interests
and
would
break
with
the
first
occasion
that
he
can
for
the
good
of
his
design

Some
in
a
ship
come
out
of
England
say
that
the
mock
Parliament
begins
to
dispute
their
privileges
with
Cromwell
but
I
fear
they
will
but
too
well
agree

Sure
Dick
Harding
has
grown
a
fish
in
his
baths
for
he
is
as
mute
as
one
tell
him
so
from
me

I
pray
tell
your
daughter
all
this
for
I
had
sealed
her
letter
before
I
had
the
certainty
of
the
news

I
have
written
thus
to
your

to

We
do
not
perceive
but
that
we
shall
rise
at
our
day

Yesterday
(
the
excise
of
beer
and
ale
being
otherwise
expired
his
Majesty
came
about
noon
to
the
Lords’
House
and
passed
only
those
two
bills
of
the
two
moieties
of
that
excise

For
though
nothing
is
too
much
for
so
gracious
a
prince
as
his
Majesty
has
been
all
along
to
us
yet
'it is
good
to
leave
something
to
give
hereafter
and
not
to
endanger
the
peoples
good
will
by
taking
their
benevolence

But
I
believe
it
will
not
signify
much

I
send
you
these
proclamations

Insomuch
that
this
last
parliament
in
a
case
of
the
like
nature
for
Royston
nothing
could
be
done
till
that
were
first
done
and
the
want
of
two
or
three
hands
concerned
did
put
a
stop
for
some
time
to
that
business

We
beseech
you
be
mindful
that
the
29th
of
May
be
kept
for
a
thanksgiving
according
to
the
act
in
that
case

MY
DEAR
FRIEND,I
am
more
afflicted
than
I
could
have
imagined
anything
in
the
world
could
have
made
me
after
the
recovery
of
a
very
troublesome
and
painful
indisposition
but
now
that
the
violence
of
that
is
abated
you
involve
me
in
a
more
insupportable
trouble
than
any
I
ever
felt
by
the
despair
you
put
me
in
of
a
happiness
I
thought
myself
sure
of
and
instead
of
using
that
freedom
with
me
that
I
have
ever
practised
in
all
my
concerns
towards
you
you
now
begin
to
put
me
with
unfriendly
excuses
by
telling
me
that
though
you
do
not
think
Mrs.
(
Joist
the
wisest
woman
in
her
country
yet
you
think
she
has
not
deserved
such
an
enemy
as
G

I
have
a
great
many
beaux
at
her
service
whose
company
I
desire
inform
yourself
and
send
me
word
when
my
coach
shall
meet
her

Aug.
the
10th
1664

It
seems
it is
true
that
my
Aunt
Temple
comes
away
for
my
cousin
Mary
Hammond
writes
my
Aunt
word
it
she
and
my
Lady
Waller
were
at
Battersay
to
see
my
uncle
and
where
they
told
her
they
expected
her
very
suddenly

He
had
as
much
at
Sadler's
brother
and
has
as
good
as
L16
where
he
now
is

Goodnight
my
dearest
I
am
Yours
D.
T

I
am
much
obliged
to
anybody
for
enquiring
where
I
am
and
indeed
if
I
could
give
any
account
of
what
I
do
here
I
should
be
better
satisfied
but
I
am
good
for
nothing
everywhere
and
you
will
have
a
hard
task
to
prove
there
is
better
company
where
there
is
neither
the
conversation
of
towns
nor
the
innocence
of
the
fields
but
a
certain
kind
of
busy
drudgery
to
the
world
of
Fashion
for
that
pitiful
nothing
that
men
call
pre-eminence
with
the
combined
incursions
of
people
who
can
neither
speak
nor
hold
their
tongue
and
yet
I
could
endure
the
sight
of
all
this
here
rather
than
be
any
more
embarquee
dans
une
affaire
si
mechante
as
the
combatting
giants
and
seeing
them
devour
the
reputations
of
the
innocent
if
I
did
not
consider
that
by
coming
to
the
place
where
these
things
are
I
shall
be
nearer
the
conversation
of
some
particular
excellent
friends
(
among
whom
I
assure
you
Mrs.
Temple
has
a
most
eminent
room
which
may
both
improve
and
delight
me
and
they
so
much
(
bias
my
inclination
that
I
cannot
but
wish
Mr.
Philips
his
occasions
may
permit
him
to
give
me
that
opportunity
this
spring
and
if
they
do
you
are
sure
to
be
tormented
with
me
so
much
that
I
think
you
are
concerned
to
wish
they
may
not
but
in
earnest
for
aught
I
perceive
I
must
never
show
any
face
there
or
among
any
reasonable
people
again
for
some
most
dishonest
person
has
got
some
collection
of
my
poems
as
I
hear
and
has
delivered
them
to
a
printer
who
I
hear
is
just
upon
putting
them
out
and
this
has
so
extremely
disturbed
me
both
to
have
my
private
folly
so
unhandsomely
exposed
and
the
belief
that
I
believe
the
most
part
of
the
world
are
apt
enough
to
believe
that
I
connived
at
this
ugly
accident
that
I
have
been
on
the
rack
ever
since
I
heard
it
though
I
have
written
to
Col

She
has
danced
country
dances
two
or
three
times
of
late
-
but
not
the
King
at
all

I
present
my
services
to
your
brother
and
sister

If
you
are
as
diligent
to
my
ill
letters
as
others
that
are
so
it is
as
much
as
is
due
to
me
though
I
am
your
Ladyship's
very
affectionate
servant

Without
this
declaration
I
hope
I
am
sufficiently
secure
never
to
run
the
hazard
of
being
censured
that
way
since
I
cannot
suspect
my
friends
of
so
much
unkindness
nor
myself
of
the
vanity
to
wish
fame
on
so
doubtful
a
foundation
as
the
caprice
of
mankind

I
pray
that
God
would
inspire
you
with
his
graces
and
blesses
you

I
doubt
it
will
hinder
the
bill
from
passing
with
us
Sir
John
Pitman
who
serves
for
Leicester
was
yesterday
suspended
from
sitting
the
house
&
from
all
privilege
till
he
find
out
Humes
(
a
most
notorious
fellow
otherwise

he
suggested
to
be
his
menial
servant

he
was
a
prisoner
for
debt
&
thus
by
Sir
Johns
procurement
has
escaped
his
Creditors

Sir
I
must
believe
you
are
very
busy
hearing
so
seldom
from
you
and
that
you
are
much
in
the
esteem
of
Dr.
Bathurst
since
he
judges
so
favourably
of
your
friends

Sir
When
I
have
assured
you
that
my
usual
indisposition
has
treated
me
so
severely
this
winter
that
I
have
had
little
leisure
to
think
of
any
thing
but
the
means
of
gaining
health
and
ease
I
am
persuaded
my
thoughts
which
was
the
greatest
captain
Caesar
or
Pompey
whether
Mr.
De
Rosny
was
not
a
great
politician
a
brave
soldier
and
the
best
servant
that
ever
prince
had
for
capacity
fidelity
and
steadiness
a
man
strangely
disinterested
infinitely
fortunate
and
every
way
qualified
to
serve
such
a
master
as
was
Henry
the
Great
who
notwithstanding
human
frailties
way
worthy
to
be
faithfully
dealt
with
since
he
knew
how
to
judge
and
to
reward

out

life

day

at
midnight
and
has
changed
the
scene
to

left
occasion

all
who

our
best

this
with
your

and
pleasure
Dear
Savile
Do
a
charity
becoming
one
of
your
pious
principles
in
preserving
your
humble
servant
Rochester
from
the
imminent
peril
of
sobriety
which
for
want
of
good
wine
more
than
company
(
for
I
drink
like
a
hermit
betwixt
God
and
my
own
conscience
is
very
like
to
befall
me

very
often
take
some
opportunity
to
talk
to
her
about
what
I
spoke
to
you
at
London

Tomorrow
I
intend
for
Woodstock
and
from
thence
to
London
where
I
hope
to
receive
your
commands

Gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
I
forgot
by
reason
of
my
haste
to
give
you
account
(
what
doubtless
you
have
known
from
other
hands
that
Sir
Robert
Sawyer
having
written
a
letter
to
Mr.
Golsbrough
clerk
of
the
Commons
to
be
read
signifying
that
he
was
by
sickness
disabled
from
performing
his
place
and
Mr.
Secretary
Williamson
informing
the
House
that
his
Majesty
gave
them
leave
to
choose
a
new
speaker
Mr.
Seymor
was
upon
Monday
last
chosen
Speaker
and
approved
at
the
Lords
bar
by
his
Majesty
in
the
usual
manner

I
am
gentlemen
etc.
Your
most
affectionate
servant
Andrew
Marvell
There
was
no
counsell
yesterday

And
how
they
will
dispose
now
of
that
is
uncertain
for
it
being
late
the
House
Adjourned
without
coming
to
any
further
Resolution

Then
the
several
paragraphs
of
the
address
were
in
order
put
to
the
question
and
upon
two
of
the
most
material
there
were
two
divisions
of
the
House

Today
a
verbal
message
as
from
the
King
was
delivered
by
secretary
Williamson
that
he
would
receive
their
address
in
the
afternoon
and
to
enter
immediately
into
consideration
of
a
supply

Also
this
prorogation
having
thus
happened
and
if
there
should
be
a
peace
it
is
now
in
the
King
and
parliament’s
power
to
revoke
the
French
prohibition
next
meeting

The
Lords
have
also
ordered
the
speech
to
be
printed
so
that
I
suppose
one
way
or
other
I
may
by
the
next
post
compose
it
for
you

Also
a
committee
to
inspect
the
laws
concerning
the
poor
in
order
to
rectify
them

They
then
received
the
report
of
the
accounts
of
the
200000
pounds
taken
upon
the
clause
for
credit
upon
the
excise
and
voted
first
upon
a
division
of
139
to
131

Then
that
they
would
not
consider
of
any
compensation
for
the
French
Prohibition
the
revenue
not
having
as
yet
suffered
by
it

In
the
copy
of
the
late
conference
where
it
speaks
that
the
states
should
have
taken
so
much
pains
in
vain
etc.
the
word
business
ought
to
have

I
remain
gentlemen
etc.

affectionate
servant

He
is
a
fair
conditioned
gentleman
and
has
a
pretty
good
estate
and
not
unlikely
to
be
ungrateful
wherefore
be
careful
of
him
and
kind
unto
him
and
render
to
answer
his
doubts
and
not
to
discourage
him

Mr.
Soames
may
be
recalled
from
Turin
since
the
prince
is
dealing
with
the
French
about
it

Examine
therefore
the
pectoral
parts
and
endeavour
to
find
out
the
ground
of
such
an
opinion
at
opportunity

If
the
profits
of
the
next
year
come
not
up
to
this
I
would
not
have
you
discouraged
for
the
profits
of
no
practise
are
equal
or
regular
and
you
have
had
some
extraordinary
patients
this
year
which
perhaps
some
years
will
not
afford

We
hear
of
2
ostriches
which
are
brought
from
Tanger

Mrs.
Dey
is
at
my
house
but
returns
with
Madame
Burwell

I
thought
to
have
sent
a
spider
by
him
which
was
brought
me
out
of
the
fields
large
and
round
and
finely
marked
green
and
even
almost
as
big
as
the
figures
enclosed
drawn
by
your
mother
for
your
sisters
dared
not
do
it
it
may
be
seen
in
Moufetus
and
I
have
had
of
them
before
and
one
drawn
out
in
oiled
colours
upon
an
oiled
paper

Dear
Son
My
cousin
Cradock
went
suddenly
away
so
that
I
could
not
enjoy
him
at
my
house
as
I
intended
present
my
service
unto
him
and
my
cousin
his
wife

But
when
this
parcel
is
spent
a
great
doubt
there
will
be
how
any
more
will
be
acquired
and
'it is
not
very
likely
that
there
is
any
true
way
delivered
in
the
book
to
make
a
new
powder
so
that
its
probable
this
parcel
will
be
soon
consumed
and
many
great
persons
who
can
be
at
the
charge
will
not
be
without
it

T.B

I
have
not
as
yet
seen
it

We
all
send
our
love
&
good
wishes

I
am
too
well
assured
of
your
Ladyship’s
kindness
to
doubt
the
part
you
take
in
this
loss
you
have
ever
showed
yourself
a
friend
in
so
many
instances
that
I
presume
upon
your
compassion
nothing
but
this
just
occasion
could
have
hindered
me
from
wellcoming
you
to
town
and
rejoicing
with
the
best
friend
I
have
in
the
world
a
friend
by
merit
and
inclination
one
I
must
esteem
as
the
wife
of
so
worthy
a
relation
and
so
sincere
a
friend
as
Sir
Sam
(
Tuke
was
to
me
and
mine

Sir
I
must
confess
I
am
extremely
pleased
I
have
done
you
any
service
in
reference
to
your
children

It
is
well
if
being
writ
(
as
it
has
been
by
scraps
at
distant
times
and
places
it
will
hold
together
and
be
of
a
piece

For
when
we
have
all
done
the
right
improvement
and
exercise
of
that
faculty
is
the
highest
perfection
of
a
man
and
furnishes
all
the
true
light
which
our
minds
can
attain
unto

In
this
choice
be
as
curious
as
you
would
be
in
that
of
a
wife
for
him

As
to
your
Carolina
affair
I
remember
the
owner
told
me
it
was
a
Landgraveship
of
fortyeight
thousand
acres
of
land
and
the
privileges
thereunto
belonging
which
are
to
be
seen
in
the
fundamental
constitutions

I
am
glad
to
hear
my
Lady
King's
son
thrives
so
very
well
but
the
Lady
I
meant
is
a
relation
of
the
Lady
that
did
me
the
honour
to
remember
to
me
in
your
last

31st
Oct

I
suppose
without
the
help
of
instances
in
your
view
you
know
of
what
value
a
trusty
servant
is

But
to
return
to
the
abele
trees
pray
what
do
you
mean
by
so
great
a
number
of
them

We
had
some
pleasant
scenes
here
which
would
come
into
the
history
of
my
travels
if
I
were
with
you
to
tell
them

Pray
present
my
humble
service
to
Madam

Sir
You
have
here
at
length
the
fourth
and
last
book
of
my
scattered
thoughts
concerning
the
understanding
and
I
see
now
more
than
ever
that
I
have
reason
to
call
them
scattered
since
never
having
looked
them
over
all
together
till
since
this
last
part
was
done
I
find
the
ill
effects
of
writing
in
patches
and
at
distant
times
as
this
whole
essay
has
been

31st
December
1686

And
I
would
by
him
also
have
sent
to
you
a
grant
of
your
estate
at
Beluton
and
St.
Thomas
to
J.
N

For
Mr.
John
Locke
these

But
notwithstanding
these
and
many
other
unexpected
misfortunes
that
have
happened
yet
Madam
and
I
are
not
totally
without
hopes
of
seeing
you
before
we
return
into
the
West
if
there
be
a
possibility
of
my
getting
so
much
time
as
to
come
to
you
which
I
most
earnestly
and
heartily
wish
for

But
by
his
discourse
I
have
reason
to
doubt
that
matter
was
not
managed
exactly
pursuant
to
the
method
directed
by
you
but
all
being
over
before
my
return
to
town
I
was
thereby
altogether
disabled
from
serving
you
in
that
affair
as
otherwise
I
should
have
done

I
thank
God
I
am
now
able
to
tell
you
that
I
am
at
present
free
from
both
and
do
hope
shall
continue
so
but
am
not
in
condition
to
go
abroad
to
dispatch
the
business
I
came
into
the
country
for
which
you
may
imagine
(
my
circumstances
considered
is
no
small
disappointment
and
trouble
to
me

Betty

her
service
to
you
and
all
her
younger
gallants
etc.

The
Duke
of
Somerset
says
he
never
remembers
seeing
him
better

My
head
and
heart
is
too
full
to
be
able
to
express
what
I
feel
for
you
and
my
self
upon
this
great
blow
to
our
family
yet
I
cannot
let
this
messenger
return
without
assuring
you
that
you
have
no
friend
bears
a
greater
share
with
you
which
I
am
doubly
concerned
in
both
for
your
sake
and
my
own

My
Lord
presents
his
humble
service
to
your
Ladyship
and
bids
me
tell
you
he
shall
think
it
a
good
fortune
if
he
be
capable
in
any
kind
to
serve
you
