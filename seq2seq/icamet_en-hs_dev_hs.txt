R.
My
lorde
Cardnal
I
comand
me
hartly
to
zou
and
I
am
glad
to
here
that
ze
doo
vell
and
I
have
ressauet
a

you
and

from
my

Dakers
vher of
I
beleffe
you
know
the
effeyt

Nevertheless
I
am
credibly
informed
that
my
almoner
is
disappointed
of
the
said
prebend
and
that
your
chaplain
hath
it
of
the
which
I
marvel
greatly
forasmuch
as
my
said
almoner
hath
done
me
good
service
in
this
country
to
the
great
honour
of
the
king
my
brother
and
mine
also
and
that
the
promise
was
made
undesired
of
my
behalf
for
you
were
the
person
that
only
moved
the
king
to
give
it
unto
my
almmoner
and
I
am
assured
that
his
grace
would
not
have
varied
without
he
had
been
persuaded
to
the
contrary

Written
this
day
of
March

Whereupon
sire
I
put
my
lord
of
Suffolk
in
choice
whether
he
would
accomplish
the
marriage
within
four
days
or
else
that
he
should
never
have
enjoyed
me
whereby
I
know
well
that
I
constrained
him
to
break
such
promises
as
he
made
your
grace
as
well
for
fear
of
losing
of
me
as
also
that
I
ascertained
him
that
by
their
consent
I
would
never
come
into
England

Beseeching
you
my
lord
at
mine
instance
and
for
my
sake
to
be
so
good
lord
unto
my
servant
John
Palgrave
master
of
art
which
hath
done
unto
me
right
good
and
acceptable
service
to
his
and
his
friends'
great
charge
and
on
my
part
as
yet
hitherto
unremembered
as
by
your
good
wisdom
and
provision
to
find
the
means
that
he
may
have
one
of

And
the
gentilmen
whiche
muste
take

to
levie
this
money
amongs
the
Kings
subjects
I
think
shalhave
no
litle
besynes
aboute
the

Oute
of
Spayne
we
have
newes
that
there
is
a
truce
or
abstynence
of
Were
taken
bitwe
themperor
and
theim
of
Fraunce

For
his
Grace
thinketh
it
a
great
hinderaunce
to
the
comen
affeires
that
th'Emperor
shold
graunt
eny
such
saufconduicte
wherby
there
shold
be

mutuall
entrecors

theyre
comen
enemyes

of

having

vtteraunce

therby
the

furnyshed
of

shold
be
the
more
able
the
lenger
to
mayntayn

And
now
he
saith
he
is
servaunt
vn to
th'Emperors
Mageste
and
is
going
in
to
Spaigne
with
lettres
to
hym
and
in dede
he
hath
diverse
lettres
to
his
Magestie
and
so
was
it
easie
for
hym
to
gete
if
he
entend
to
deceive
and
mocke
as
the
Kingis
Grace
thinketh
that
he
doth

All
which
lettres
and
copies
I
haue
distinctely
redde
vn to
his
Grace

And
thus
our

long
preserve

in

I
bid
you
farewell
this
xvjth
of
Octob.
1583

I
hope
you
more
esteme
your
honor
than
to
give
yt
such
a
staine
since
you
have
protested
so
often
to
have
taken
these
Lordes
for
your
most
affectionate
subjects
and
to
have
done
all
for
your
best

Mr.
Broughton
I
forgot
in
my
l'res
to
write
for
Mr.
Aldersey's
bills
to
be
sent
over
in
hast
by
Merik

I
am
sure
there

a
c
of
these
alredy
delyvered
and
the
rest
wylbe
before
I
can
revoke
them
having
apointed

Whereuppon

M=r=
secretary
I
can
not
imagin
nether
wyll
I
meddell
withall
but
must
obey
her
majesties
pleasure
yf
she
have
determyned
any
alteration
which
I
desyer
to
hear
from
you
for
yf
I
com
to
the
court
yt
must
more
easyly
breake
out
as
yt
wyll
notwithstanding
and
I
can
but
greve
at
the
myserable
estate
of
the
pore
aflycted
as
for
my
owne
hit
must
be
as
the
potters
vessell
&c.

I
trust
my
good
lord
now
that
I
have
taken
this
voyage
uppon
me
to
serve
hir

your

of
me
poore

but
of
the
cause
comytted
now
to
my

chifely

My
lord
no
man
feleth
comfort
but
they
that
have
cause
of
grefe
and
no
men
have
so
much
nede
of
relyfe
and
comfort
as
those
that
goe
in
these
dowbtfull
servyces

They
so
shooke
him
upp
and
with
such
termes
naming
hir
majesty
in
skorn
as
they
tooke
yt
as
they
hurld
him

letters
and
bidd
him
content
himself
they
wold
first
dischardge
all
the
least
dewtyes
whatsoever
to
hir

before
they
wold

God

dealinges
accordingly

some

Thus
referring
ye
for
the
rest
to
Mr.
Davyson
at
his
coming
I
wyll
take
my
leave
protestyng

The
circumstance

may
please
yow
to
have
of
this
bearer

And
Mr.
Quarles
hath
sent
down
divers
supplies
more
than
allowance
for
the
numbers
were
great
before
we
entered
into
the
six
weeks'
victuals

It
might
have
bred
some
mischief
but
it
was
quickly
put
out

My
Lord
on
Wednesday
last
I
went
to
Harwich
to
see
the
town
and
the
haven
which
I
had
not
seen
this
27
years

My
good
Lord
God
send
you
ever
well
to
do
and
so
I
bid
your
Lordship
most
heartily
farewell

I
would
fain
keep
the
Narrow
Seas
three
or
four
months
I
persuade
myself
I
shall
do
some
service

If
it
were
not
for
you
I
should
live
in
a
dead
place
for
hearing
of
anything

I
will
have
a
watch
on
them

Sir
I
had
forgotten
in
my
last
letter
to
answer
the
matter
you
did
write
in
touching
Captain
Morgan
my
man

I
do
assure
you
they
live
here
bountifully
and
it
will
be
hard
finding
of
such
noblemen
as
these
be
so
well
affected
to
this
service
and
that
will
love
the
sea
so
well
as
they
do

My
honourable
and
good
Lord
I
have
received
your
letter
even
as
I
was
weighing
to
go
out
and
for
the
first
part
I
am
most
heartily
to
give
your
Lordship
thanks
for
your
honourable
favour

And
so
my
Lord
having
no
more
leisure
to
write
at
large
being
under
sail
I
bid
your
Lordship
most
heartily
farewell

If
your
Majesty
thought
it
meet
it
would
not
be
amiss
you
sent
presently
to
Denmark
to
understand
the
truth
and
to
deal
with
their
King
according
to
your
Majesty's
great
wisdom

Thirdly
at
Calais
by
fire
we
forced
them
to
cut
many
of
their
cables
whereby
they
lost
many
of
their
anchors
which
of
necessity
they
must
seek
to
supply

The
winter
will
overtake
them
else
in
those
parts

For
that
we
were
very
near
to
set
sail
I
most
humbly
beseech
your
Honour
to
pardon
my
pen
for
that
I
am
forced
to
write
the
very
copy
of
that
letter
which
I
have
sent
to
my
Lord
Chancellor

Your
Honour's
faithfully
to
be
commanded
FRA.
DRAKE

And
yet
with
my
consent
we
ought
much
more
to
have
regard
unto
the
Duke
of
Parma
and
his
soldiers
than
to
the
Duke
of
Sidonia
and
his
ships
for
that
our
sands
will
take
a
strong
party
with
us
against
his
great
ships
under
water

I
think
it
one
of
the
best
services
we
can
have
in
hand

should
now
giue
glorie
vnto
his
greatnesse
for
penetrating
in
his
power
his
hand
lyes
haeuy
vpon
me
he
hath
spoken
vnto
me
with
a
voyce
of
thunder
and
I
haue
felt
he
is
a
God
that
can
punish
enemies

With
thee
I
ioyne
young
Juuenall
that
byting
satyrist
that
lastly
with
mee
together
writ
a
comedie

For
other
new
commers
I
leaue
them
to
the
mercie
of
these
painted
monsters
who
I
doubt
not
will
driue
the
best-minded
to
despise
them
for
the
rest
it
skills
not
though
they
make
a
ieast
at
them

Desirous
that
you
should
liue
though
himselfe
be
dying
ROBERT
GREEENE

Thus
God
hath
cast
mee
downe
that
I
might
bee
humbled
and
punished
me
for
example
of
others
sinne
and
although
he
suffers
me
in
this
world
to
perish
without
succour
yet
trust
I
in
the
world
to
come
to
find
mercy
by
the
merits
of
my
Sauiour
to
whom
I
commend
thee
and

SIR
Although

awnswere
I
receved
from
you
two
daies
since
gave
mee
small
incouragement
to
flatter
my self
that
anie

my
unfortunat

hade
it
not
pleased
God
to
powre
uppon
mee
one
affliction
after
an
other
and
to
add
to
the
immesurable
sorrowes
of
my
harte
so
violent
a
sicknes
as
I
am
not
able
of
my self
to
stur
out
of
my

I
had
presented
unto
your
vew
the
image
of
the
importunate
Widow
mentioned
in
the
Scriptur
and
had
never
ceased
to
pester
you
with
my
complaines
till
you
had
afforded
me
some
assurance
that
whatsoever
respects
might
dehorte
you
from
so
much
as
wishinge
my
husband's
good
yet
that
an
afflicted
and
wofull
lady
should
not
wholly
loose

desperate
of

And
so
much
I
haue
sent
to
some
of

But
remember
that
nothing
is
flattery
which
the
speaker
believes
and
of
the
grossest
flattery
there
is
this
good
use
that
they
tell

what
we

Of
which
since
I

a

tell
you
sometimes
that
by
your

DEAR
CORNWALLIS
I
KNOW
that
by
this
tyme
I
have
deserved
and
undergonne
much
of
your
censuer
if
I
have
not
lost
all
your
favor
which
to
redeem
I
do
protest
unto
you
that
the
only
cause
you
have
binne
so
long
without
hearing
from
me
was
that
I
was
ashamed
to
send
till
I
could
retorne
you
that
part
of
your
wealth
you
have
so
long
binne
pleased
to
trust
me
with
to
whom
alone
I
had
binne
beholding
for
a
curtesy
of
this
natur

For
the
first
I
assure
you
your
newe
nephew
is
as
fine
and
towardly
a
youth
as
any
l
know
and
for
the
other
my
Lo.
Hamilton
my
Lo.
Chamberlain
and
my
Lo.
of
Mongommery
have
donne
ther
best
and
will
do
still
to
keep
off
all
the
blows
they
can
others'
malice
aymes
at
her
but
what
the
successe
will
be
I
dare
not
promis
so
strongly
is
the
K.
insensed
and
so
bitter
yett
in
the
prosecution
but
I
will
assure
you
if
ther
wear
no
other
ground
but
that
of
her
blood
itt
shall
make
me
keepe
warmest
in
my
freinds
desiers
to
save
her
from
publick
shame
and
I
beseech
you
since
your
own
vertue
exsempts
you
from
all
reproch
in
her
be
so
just
to
yourself
as
not
to
be
afflicted
with
her
danger

This
donne
I
intend
to
turn
Combe
wholly
into
money
bothe
to
make
myself
a
free
woman
from
debt
and
with
the
rest
of
itt
to
rayse
as
good
an
estate
for
lyfe
as
I
can
having
now
nonne
but
myselfe
to
provide
for
those
designes
I
had
for
my
neese
being
crossed
by
her
father's
untowardnes
and
her
owne
porcion
being
sufficient
for
any
matche

Doe

recōmend
me
affectionatly

Therfore

you
to
the
begetting
or
nourishing
of
those
mistrusts

turne
more
to

which
I
hope
will
passe
with
safety
and
end
to
your
comfort
unto

if
I

BEDFORD

Since
your
goeing
my
Lo.
of
Kensington
is
comme
out
of
France
who
brings
word
that
they
are
so
desirous
of
that
mache
as
I
believe
itt
will
presently
be
both
concluded
and
she
hear
eare
long
upon
less
ill
condicions
then
Spaine
insisted
on
for
matter
of
religion

The
King
is
pleased
to
use
my
Lord
Chamberlain
that
is
as
graciously
as
any
man
which
gives
many
much
confidence
seeing
the
King
so
well
inclined
to
favour
honest
men
which
he
is
known
to
be
and
one
that
will
never
abuse
his
trust

But
now
I
have
many
reasons
to
assure
myself
he
expected
not
to
live
out
this
year
though
he
was
sparingest
to
utter
that
to
those
he
knew
loved
him
best
for
grieving
them
yett
now
I
call
to
mind
many
speeches
of
his
I
heeded
not
when
they
wear
spoken
might
have
made
me
take
more
hold
what
his
opinion
was
of
his
short
continuance
on
earth
where
he
hath
not
left
such
another
nor
any
creature
so
great
a
loser
as
I
in
the
death
of
a
friend
whom
if
it
had
pleased
God
to
have
longer
spared
us
would
at
this
tyme
both
to
the
publick
and
his
private
friends
have
binne
that
wee
must
not
look
to
see
any
other

Thus
with
the
remembrans
of
my
neuer
enough
aknowledged
loue
and
seruis
to
you
I
rest
your

Sir
William
Plaiter
will
acquaint
you
with
the
busines
of
my
Lord
Banning's
daughters
which
we
thinke
very
good
marages
and
not
hard
to
be
gotten
by
you
because
you
have
a
great
many
frends
to
make
way
for
you
as
my
Lord
of
Dorset
and
Sir
Henry
German
that
are
nere
kinsmen
to
them

I
spake
with
Mister
Chitting
about
Sir
Thomas
Barrington’s
neese
he
semes
to
thinke
she
is
worth
seven
thousand
pounds

will
wright

you

Sir
William
Plaiters
is
in
this
towne
and
hath
bene
ever
sins
he
came
from
you
but
he
hath
bene
ill
of
late
with
soare
eyes

Soe
I
altogether
concealed
our
name
and
urdged
no
further
because
we
have
little
reason
to
undervalue
ourselves
soe
much
as
to
importune
that
which
so
much
deserves
to
be
mett
at
least
half
way
in

I
hope
a
better
will
come
in
your
way
in
the
meane time
and
if
a
good
offer
comes
I
presume
you
will
not
delay
it
for
it
is
hard
to
meet
with
one
whose
person
and
portion
is
without
exseption

My
mother
is
very
ill

If
you
do
I
must
be
pardoned
what
my
relation
to
the
Public
calls
for

To
my
honoured
Friends
the
Deputy
Lieutenants
for
the
County
of
Suffolk

Gentlemen
command
Your
servant
OLIVER
CROMWELL

I
beseech
you
therefore
consider
this
Gentleman
and
the
soldiers
and
if
it
be
possible
make
up
his
Company
a
Hundred-and-twenty
and
send
them
away
with
what
expedition
is
possible

Some
time
they
must
have
for
exercise

I
protest
if
it
were
for
myself
I
would
not
move
you

I
am
neglected
exceedingly

My
estate
is
little

He
hath
not
one
able
to
put
on
'that
business.'
The
Force
will
fall
if
some
help
not

But
we
got
to
horse
and
retreated
in
good
order
with
the
safety
of
all
our
Horse
of
the
Association
not
losing
four
of
them
that
I
hear
of
and
we
got
five
of
theirs

The
horses
that
his
Cornet
Boulry
took
he
will
put
himself
upon
that
issue
for
them
all

Let
them
therefore
if
I
be
thought
worthy
of
any
favour
leave
your
Country
with
your
good
wishes
and
a
blessing

Not
that
I
would
for
ten
thousand
horses
have
the
Horse
to
my
own
private
benefit
saving
to
make
use
of
him
for
the
Public
for
I
will
most
gladly
return
the
value
of
him
to
the
State

Admit
he
be
shall
that
render
him
incapable
to
serve
the
Public

If
there
be
any
other
offence
to
be
charged
upon
him
that
must
in
a
judicial
way
receive
determination

This
is
all
but
that
I
am
ready
to
serve
you
and
rest
Your
loving
friend
OLIVER
CROMWELL

I
have
offered
him
now
another
place
of
meeting
to
come
to
which
I
suppose
he
will
not
deny
me
and
that

be

The
giving

Gentlemen
We
are

shall
strive

We
can
not
but
consider
that
he
has
a
brother
Captain
in
your
garrison
&
that
this
Gentleman
also
has
imployd
his
intrest
since
he
was
in
this
Parlt
to
continue
you
a
garrison

(
My
Lord
Bellasis
is
coming
down
within
three
or
foure
days)

We
do
not
perceiue
but
that
we
shall
rise
at
our
day

Yesterday
(
the
Excise
of
Beere
and
Ale
being
otherwise
expired
his
Majesty
came
about
noon
to
the
Lords
house
&
passed
onely
those
two
bills
of
the
two
moityes
of
that
excise

For
though
nothing
be
too
much
for
so
gracious
a
Prince
as
his
Majesty
hath
been
all
along
to
us
yet
'tis
good
to
leaue
something
to
giue
hereafter
&
not
to
indanger
the
peoples
good
will
by
taking
their
benevolence

But
I
believe
it
will
not
signify
much

I
send
you
these
Proclamations

Insomuch
that
this
last
Parlament
in
a
case
of
the
like
nature
for
Royston
nothing
could
be
done
till
that
were
first
done
&
the
want
of
two
or
three
hands
concerned
did
put
a
stop
for
some
time
to
that

according

MY
DEARE
FRIEND,-I
am
more
afflicted
then
I
could
have
imagined
anything
in
the
world
could
have
maide
me
after
the
recovry
of
a
very
troublesome
and
painful
indisposition
but
now
that
the
violence
of
that
is
abated
you
involve
me
in
a
more
insupportable
trouble
then
any
I
ever
felt
by
the
despaire
you
putt
me
in
of
a
happynesse
I
thought
myselfe
sure
of
and
instead
of
using
that
freedome
with
me
that
I
have
ever
practised
in
all
my
concerns
towards
you
you
now
begin
to
put
me
with
unfriendly
excuses
by
telling
me
that
though
you
doe
not
thinke
Mrs.

Joist
the
wisest
woman
in

country

seems
tis
true

my
Aunt
Temple

away
for
my
cousin
Mary
Hammond
writes
my
Aunt
word
yt
she

Waller
were
at

to
see
my

Goodnight
my
dearest
I
am
Yours
D.
T

I
am
much
obliged
to
anybody
for
enquiring
where
I
am
and
indeed
if
I
could
give
any
account
of
what
I
doe
here
I
should
be
better
satiffy'd
but
I
am
good
for
nothing
everywhere
and
you
will
have
a
hard
task
to
prove
there
is
better
company
where
there
is
neither
ye
conversation
of
towns
nor
ye
innocency
of
ye
fields
but
a
certain
kind
of
busy
drudgery
to
ye
world
of
Fashion
for
that
pittiful
nothing
that
men
call
pre-eminence
with
the
combined
incursions
of
people
who
can
neither
speak
nor
hold
their
tongue
and
yet
I
could
endure
the
sight
of
all
this
here
rather
than
be
any
more
embarquee
dans
une
affaire
si
mechante
as
ye
combatting
gyants
and
seeing
them
devour
ye
reputations
of
ye
innocent
if
I
did
not
consider
that
by
coming
to
the
place
where
these
things
are
I
shall
be
nearer
ye
conversation
of
some
particular
excellent
friends
(
among
whom
I
assure
you
Mrs.
Temple
has
a
most
eminent
room
which
may
both
improve
and
delight
me
and
they
so
much
(
byass
my
inclination
that
I
cannot
but
wish
Mr.
Philips
his
occasions
may
permit
him
to
give
me
yt
opportunity
this
spring
and
if
they
doe
you
are
sure
to
be
tormented
with
me
soe
much
yt
I
think
you
are
concerned
to
wish
they
may
not
but
in
earnest
for
aught
I
perceive
I
must
never
show
any
face
there
or
among
any
reasonable
people
again
for
some
most
dishonest
person
hath
got
some
collection
of
my
Poems
as
I
heare
and
hath
deliver'd
them
to
a
Printer
who
I
heare
is
just
upon
putting
them
out
and
this
hath
soe
extreamly
disturbed
me
both
to
have
my
private
folly
so
unhandsomely
exposed
and
ye
belief
that
I
believe
the
most
part
of
ye
worlde
are
apt
enough
to
believe
yt
I
connived
at
this
ugly
accident
that
I
have
been
on
ye
rack
ever
since
I
heard
it
though
I
have
written
to
Col

She
has
danced
country
dances
two
or
three
times
of
late

at
all

I
present
my
services
to
yr.
Brother
and
Sister

If
you
are
as
diligent
to
my
ill
letters
as
others
that

'tis
as
much
as
is
due
to
me
though
I
am
your
Ladyships
very
affectionate
servant

Without
this
declaration
I
hope
I
am
sufficiently
secure
never
to
runne
the
hazard
of
being
censured
that
way
since
I
cannot
suspect
my
friends
of
so
much
unkindnesse
nor
myselfe
of
the
vanity
to
wish
fame
on
so
doubtfull
a
foundation

caprice

If

yeare
come
not
up
to

I
would
not
have
you
discouraged
for
the
profitts
of
no
practise
are
equall
or
regular
&
you
have
had
some
extraordinary
patients
this

perhaps
some
yeares

I
thought
to
have
sent
a

by
him
which
was
brought
mee
out
of

My

went
suddenly
awaye
so
that
I
could
not

at

I
intended
present

service
unto

my

when
this
parcell
is
spent
a
great
doubt
there
wil
bee
how
any
more
will
bee
acquired
&
'tis
not
very
likely
that
there
is
any
true
way
delivered
in
the
booke
to
make
a
newe
powder
so
that
tis
probable
this
parcell
will
bee
soone
consumed
&
many
great
persons
who
can
bee
at
the
charge
will
not
bee
without
it

T.B

I
have
not
as
yet
seen
it

Wee
all
send
our
love
&
good
wishes

I
am
too
well
assured
of
y=r=
L=ps=
kindnesse
to
doubt
the
part
you
take
in
this
losse
you
have
ever
shewed
y=r=selfe
a
friend
in
so
many
instances
that
I
presume
upon
y=r=
compassion
nothing
but
this
just
occasion
could
have
hindered
me
from
wellcoming
you
to
towne
and
rejoyceing
with
the
best
friend
I
have
in
the
world
a
friend
by
merit
and
inclination
one
I
must
esteeme
as
the
wife
of
so
worthy
a
relation
and
so
sincere
a
friend
as
S=r=
Sam
(
Tuke
was
to
me
and
mine

Sir
I
must
confess
I
am
extremely
pleased
I
have
done
you
any
service
in
reference
to
your
children

It
is
well
if
being
writ
(
as
it
has
been
by
scraps
at
distant
times
and
places
it
will
hold
together
and
be
of
a
piece

For
when
we
have
all
done
the
right
improvement
and
exercise
of
that
faculty
is
the
highest
perfection
of
a
man
and
furnishes
all
the
true
light
which
our
minds
can
attain
unto

In
this
choice
be
as
curious
as
you
would
be
in
that
of
a
wife

him

Amsterdam
4th

1686

As
to
your
Carolina
affair
I
remember
the
owner
told
me
it
was
a
Landgraveship
of
forty-eight
thousand
acres
of
land
and
the
privileges
thereunto
belonging
which
are
to
be
seen
in
the
Fundamental
Constitutions

I
am
glad
to
hear
my
Lady
King's
son
thrives
so
very
well
but
the
Lady
I
meant
is
a
relation
of
the
Lady
that
did
me
the
honour
to
remember
to
me
in
your
last

31st
Oct

I
suppose
without
the
help
of
instances
in
your
view
you
know
of
what
value
a
trusty
servant
is

But
to
return
to
the
ablele
trees
pray
what
do
you
mean
by
so
great
a
number
of
them

We
had
some
pleasant
scenes
here
which
would
come
into
the
history
of
my
travels
if
I
were
with
you
to
tell
them

Pray
present
my
humble
service
to
Madam

Sir
You
have
here
at
length
the
fourth
and
last
book
of
my
scattered
thoughts
concerning
the
Understanding
and
I
see
now
more
than
ever
that
I
have
reason
to
call
them
scattered
since
never
having
looked
them
over
all
together
till
since
this
last
part
was
done
I
find
the
ill
effects
of
wrting
in
patches
and
at
distant
times
as
this
whole
essay
has
been

31st
Dec.
1686

And
I
would
by
him
also
have
sent
to
you
a
grant
of
your
estate
at
Beluton
and
St.
Thomas
to
J.
N

For
Mr.
John
Locke
These

But
notwithstanding
these
and
many
other
unexpected
misfortunes
that
have
happened
yet
Madam
and
I
are
not
totally
without
hopes
of
seeing
you
before
we
return
into
the
West
if
there
be
a
possibility
of
my
getting
so
much
time
as
to
come
to
you
which
I
most
earnestly
and
heartily
wish
for

But
by
his
discourse
I
have
reason
to
doubt
that
matter
was
not
managed
exactly
pursuant
to
the
method
directed
by
you
but
all
being
over
before
my
return
to
town
I
was
therby
altogether
disabled
from
serving
you
in
that
affair
as
otherwise
I
should
have
done

I
thank
God
I
am
now
able
to
tell
you
that
I
am
at
present
free
from
both
and
do
hope
shall
continue
so
but
am
not
in
condition
to
go
abroad
to
dispatch
the
business
I
came
into
the
country
for
which
you
may
imagine
(
my
circumstances
considered
is
no
small
disappointment
and
trouble
to
me

Miss
Betty

her
service
to
you
and
all
her
younger
gallants
etc.

The
Duke
of
Somersett
says
he
never
remembers
seeing
him
better

My
head
and
heart
is
too
full
to
be
able
to
express
what
I
feel
for
you
and
my
selfe
upon
this
great
blow
to
our
family
yet
I
cant
let
this
messenger
return
without
assuring
you
that
you
have
no
friend
bears
a
greater
share
with
you
wch
I
am
doubly
concerned
in
both
for
your
sake
and
my
own

My
Lord
presents
his
humble
service
to
your
La=p=
and
bids
mee
tell
you
he
shall
thinke
it
a
good
fortune
if
he
be
capable
in
any
kind
to
serve
you
