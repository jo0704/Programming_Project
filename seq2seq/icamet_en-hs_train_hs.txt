Furthermore
the
duke
of
Bretagne
otherwise
called
the
dauphin
hath
divers
seasons
moved
me
to
write
to
your
grace
for
the
said
Francois
forasmuch
as
he
is
one
of
his
servants
the
which
to
do
I
made
him
promise
and
to
the
duke
of
Longuevilee
also
for
I
assure
your
grace
they
made
me
and
the
noblemen
of
my
company
great
cheer
from
Bologne
forth
as
the
duke
of
Norfolk
the
lord
marquis
with
other
noble
men
can
inform
your
grace

These
premises
considered
I
beseech
your
grace
to
desire
the
lord
Darcy
to
deliver
upon
as
little
a
ransom
as
reasonably
may
be
his
said
prisoner
for
as
I
am
credibly
informed
here
he
is
but
a
poor
gentleman

Now
somewhat
I
would
that
my
lord
the
king
(
and
the
both
dukes
to
whom
I
am
much
bound
should
think
he
should
be
the
more
favoured
for
my
sake

When
this
man
is
delivered
I
beseech
you
to
send
word
by
the
bringer
of
this
or
some
other
what
his
ransom
is
which
I
pray
God
may
be
reasonable
and
little
who
preserve
your
grace

Amen

Mine
own
good

I
recommend
me
unto
your

thank
you

the

that
you

the
which
has
been
the

comfort
might
be
unto
me
in
this

desiring
your

so
for
to

for
there
is
nothing
so
great
a
store
to
me
as
for
to
see
you
the
which
I
would
very
fain
have
the
time

come

I

it
shall

else
I

very
sorry
for
I
think
every
day
a
thousand
till
I
may
see
you

Sire
whereas
your

sends
me
word
that
I
will
not
give
no
credence
to
them
for
no
suit
nor
for
no
other
words
that
shall
be
given
me
sire
I
prosmise
your
grace
that
I
never
made
them
no
promise
nor
no
other
for
them
nor
never
will
until
that
I
know
your
grace's
mind
for
nobody
alive
for
your
grace
is
all
the
comfort
that
I
have
in
this
world
and
I
trust
your
grace
will
not
fail
for
I
have
nothing
in
this
world
that
I
care
for
but
to
have
the
good
and
kind
mind
that
your
grace
had
ever
toward
me
which
I
beseech
your
grace
to
continue
for
therein
is
my
trust
that
I
have
in
this
world

Sire
as
for
the
letter
that
your
grace
did
send
me
by
Master
Clinton
whereas
you
send
me
word
that
I
should
provide
myself
and
make
me
ready
for
to
come
to
your
grace
sire
an
it

I
would

your
mind
for
an
when

Sire
I
beseech
your

for
to
be
good
lord
to
Mr.
John
your
surgeon
for
my
sake
and
that
you
will
not
be
miscontented
with
him
for
his
long
tarrying
here
with
me

I
bore
him
an
hand
that
your
grace
were
contented
that
he
should
be
here
with

I
pray
your
grace
to
give
him
leave
for
to
tarry
here
awhile
with
me
for
because
I
am
very
ill-diseased
with

toothache

some

My

good

In
my
most
hearty
manner
I
recommend
me
unto
you
letting
you
the
same
to
understand
that
my
lord
of
Suffolk
hath
sent
me
your
letters
which
lately
he
received
by
Cooke
by
which
I
perceive
the
faithful
good
mind
which
you
do
bear
unto
us
both
and
how
that
you
be
determined
not
to
leave
us
in
our
extreme
trouble
for
the
which
your
most
fast
(
faithful
and
loving
dealing
I
most
entirely
thank
you
requiring
you
to
continue
towards
us
as
you
have
been
which
shall
never
be
forgotten
in
any
of
our
behalfs
but
to
the
uttermost
of
our
power
we
shall
be
always
ready
to
shew
you
all
faithfull
kindness
as
knoweth
our
Lord
who
send
you
long
life

By
your
loving
friend
MARY

Brother
King
Henry
VIII

A.D

1515

Pleaseth
it
your
grace
to
my
greatest
discomfort
sorrow
and
disconsolation
but
lately
I
have
been
advertised
of
the
great
and
high
displeasure
which
your
highness
beareth
unto
me
and
my
lord
of
Suffolk
for
the
marriage
between
us

Sire
I
will
not
in
any
wise
deny
but
that
I
have
offended
your
grace
for
the
which
I
do
put
myself
most
humbly
in
your
clemency
and
mercy

Nevertheless
to
the
intent
that
your
highness
should
not
think
that
I
had
simply
carnally
or
of
any
sensual
appetite
done
the
same
I
having
no
regard
to
fall
in
your
grace's
displeasure
I
assure
your
grace
that
I
had
never
done
against
your
ordinance
and
consent
but
by
the
reason
of
the
great
despair
wherein
I
was
put
by
the
two
friars
which
hath
certified
me
in
case
I
come
to
England
your
council
would
never
consent
to
the
marriage
between
the
said
lord
and
me
with
many
other
sayings
concerning
the
same
promise
so
that
I
verily
thought
that
the
said
friars
would
never
have
offered
to
have
made
me
like
overture
unless
they
might
have
had
charge
from
some
of
your
council
the
which
put
me
in
such
consternation
fear
and
doubt
of
the
obtaining
of
the
thing
which
I
desired
most
in
this
world
that
I
rather
chose
to
put
me
in
your
mercy
accomplishing
the
marriage
than
to
put
me
in
the
order
of
your
council
knowing
them
to
be
other ways
minded

By
your
loving
and
most
humble
sister
MARY

To
the
King's
grace

Queen-Dowager
of

Wolsey

A.D

My
very
good
lord
With
all
my
heart
I
commend
me
unto
you

I
understand
that
it
hath
pleased
the
king
my
brother
to
promote
doctor
West
being
here
one
of
his
ambassadors
to
the
bishoprick
of
Ely
whereof
I
am
right
glad

By
reason
of
which
promotion
he
must
depart
with
divers
of
his
benefices
among
which
he
hath
two
one
called
Egglesfield
in
the
bishopric
of
Durham
and
the
other
the
archdaeconry
of
Derby
which
(
as
I
am
informed
be
of
no
great
value

thus

Ghost
preserve
you

the

MASTER
MORE

Albeit
I
am
very
joieuslx
that
my
procedingis
devises
and
conferencis
with
the
Ambassadeurs
haue
been
to
the
Kingis
contentacion
with
th'Ambassadors
in
putting
ouer
without
discoraging
of
the
confederatis
his
Gracis
entre
in
to
the
liege
yet
nowe
I
am
in
noo
smal
perplexite
howe
the
same
may
be
continued
forasmoch
as
commissions
and
auctorites
aswel
from
the
Popes
Holynes
as
from
the
Seniory
of
Venise
be
arrived
here
and
howerly
the
Ambassador
of
Fraunce
lokith
for
the
semblable
from
his
master

For
nowe
if
vpon
the
exhibition
of
the
said
commissions
I
shuld
not
fal
in
treaty
with
them
vpon
the
kingis
said
entree
there
might
therby
be
goven
vnto
them
vehement
cause
of
suspition
which
percase
might
dryve
them
the
rather
in
to
th'Emperors
deuotion
and
the
lesse
herafter
to
esteme
the
Kingis
Highnes

And
in
my
poore
opinion
it
shal
more
stande
with
the
Kingis
honnor
and
reputacion
thus
to
procede
with
the
said
Ambassadors
thenne
not
to
treate
with
them
considering
they
be
furnished
with
such
commissions
as
was
or
is
devised
and
desired
by
the
Kingis
Highnes

Better
it
shalbe
thus
to
passe
the
tyme
and
dalye
with
them
thenne
nowe
to
make
any
expresse
refusal
eyther
of
the
Kingis
said
entre
or
else
to
delay
to
commone
and
treate
vpon
the
same
nam
inter
tractandum
varia
occurrere
et
incidere
possint
que
rem
vt
tua
prudentia
facile
perspicit
citra
suspitionem
differe
et
protelare
queant

It
is
sumwhat
to
my
marvel
that
the
Kingis
Hihgnes
as
I
haue
by
myn
other
lettres
signified
vnto
you
makith
difficulte
for
the
lending
of
the
Peter
Pumgarnet
to
the
Ambassador
of
Fraunce
considering
the
manifold
good
desertis
of
the
said
Ambassador
and
the
gret
profit
and
commodite
that
shal
arrise
vnto
his
Grace
therby

And
in
my
jugement
it
is
not
to
be
suspected
or
feared
that
she
shall
or
may
be
used
by
the
said
Ambassador
against
the
Kingis
Highnes
in
any
hostilite
considering
that
the
suerties
shalbe
bounde
aswel
for
that
point
as
for
her
rediliuerey
at
the
yeres
ende
and
then
there
is
more
lightlynes
of
strayter
collection
with
Fraunce
thenne
of
any
brech

And
where
as
your
lettres
purportith
that
the
Kingis
Highnes
may
haue
fyve
hundred
markis
for
the
loone
of
the
said
ship
besides
the
advauntage
of
his
custumes
of
his
owne
subgettis
and
thereunto
it
is
to
be
considered
that
the
custumes
of
the
straungers
amountith
far
aboue
the
custumes
of
his
owne
subgettis

Wherfor
for
oon
hundred
pownde
payde
by
the
Englishemen
the
straungers
payith
nyne
hyndred

Besides
this
I
suppose
if
the
King
haue
for
the
loone
of
her
fyve
hundred
markis
his
Grace
must
newe
rigge
trymme
and
tacle
her
at
his
owne
coste
and
charge
which
percase
wol
surmounte
the
somme
of
the
said
fyve
hundred
markis
wher as
the
Ambassadour
offrith
to
doo
the
same
at
his
owne
proper
exspress
cost
and
charge

Moore
thenne
this
I
cannot
saye
remitting
al
to
the
Kingis
noble
pleasour
and
gratitude
most
humbly
beseching
his
grace
to
haue
consideration
of
such
good
office
as
the
said
ambassador
hath
and
dayly
may
doo
for
the
advauncement
of
his
present
affayres

You
may
shewe
vnto
his
Grace
that
I
wold
suffre
noon
of
them
to
passe
out
of
his
Mynte
and
be
curraunt

such
tyme
as
his
Grace
had
seene
the
prynte
and
facion
of
the
same
and
his
pleasor
notified
vnto
me
therupon
accordingly

And
where
as
you
haue
notified
vnto
me
that
the
Kingis
pleasor
is
that
his
Gracis
aunswer
to
Luthers
lettre
shold
be
immediately
sent
forth
to
the
princes
of
Almayne
without
abidiging
or
tarying
for
the
copie
therof
I
thinke
therin
that
meseemeth
it
is
not
convenient
that
this
shuld
be
doon
in
my
poore
opinion
aswel
for
that
Luther
who
is
ful
of
sutelte
and
craft
herafter
might
percase
denye
that
any
such

hath
been

vnto
the

Highnes
as
that
the

not

adioyned
therunto
shuld
be

want
therof
to
the
reders
and
herers
therof
sumwhat
diminute
and
obscure

not

perceyved

your

although
this
by
the
perill
of
their

would
doe

more
hurt

I
settle
my

the

the

I
pray

with

declare

Our
Lord
blesse
you

My
dearely
beloved
Daughter
I
doubt
not
but
by
reason
of
the
kinges
Councellours
resorting
hither
in
this
tyme
in
which
the
fathers
of
the
Charter
house
and
some
others
be
iudged
to
death
for
treason
may
hap
to
put
you
in
some
feare
for
me
especiallie
for
that
it
is
not
vnlikely
but
that
you
haue
hard
that
I
also
was
brought
before
them
I
thought
it
necessarie
to
advertise
you
to
the
end
that
you
should
not
conceave
more
hope
then
the
matter
giveth
or
more
greife
then
the
present
occasion
ministreth

I
was
offered
to
sitt
downe
with
them
but
in
no
wise
I
would

Maister
Secreatrie
told
me
that
he
nothing
doubted
but
that
I
had
seene
the
new
statutes
made
the
last
sitting
of
the
Parliament

I
aunswered
yea
verilie
howbeit
for
as
much
as
I
being
here
and
not
minding
to
medle
with
Those
matters
any
more
I
thought
it
litle
nede
for
me
to
bestow
much
tyme
vpon
them

He
asked
me
whether
I
had
red
the
first
statute
of
the
kings
being
heade
of
the
Church

I
aunswered
Yea

Then
his
maisterhip
declared
vnto
me
that
sith
it
was
now
by
act
of
Parliament
ordeined
that
his
Highnes
and
his
heires
is
and
was
and
perpetuallie
should
be
supreame
head
in
earth
of
the
Church
of
England
immediatelie
vnder
Christ
the
kings
pleasure
was
that
these
here
of
his
Counsell
assembled
should
demaund
my
opinion
therein

Whervnto
I
aunswered
that
in
good
faith
I
had
well
trusted
that
his
Highnes
would
never
haue
commaunded
any
such
question
to
be
asked
of
me
considering
that
I
ever
from
the
beginning
well
and
trulie
declared
my
minde
to
his
Maiestie
and
also
vnto
your
Maistership
both
by
mouth
and
writing
and
now
I
haue
discharged
my
mynde
of
all
such
matters
meaning
not
hereafter
to
dispute
kinges
or
Popes
titles

I
am
the
kings
faithfull
subiect
and
wilbe
and
daylie
pray
for
hym
and
all
his
Realme
and
otherwise
then
this
I
intend
not
to
medle

And
for
you
maister
More
I
knowe
so
much
that
his
Grace
would
be
glad
to
see
you
take
such
conformable
waies
that
you
might
be
abroade
againe
with
a
great
creadit
and
worship
as
ever
you
were

Wherevnto
I
aunswered
I
would
not
medle
in
the
world
againe
to
have
all
the
world
given
me
as
in
effect
I
aunswered
before

"
Then
was
I
commaunded
to
goe
forth
awhile
and
presently
called
in
againe

Then
said
maister
Secretarie
vnto
me
Though
you
are
a
prisoner
condemned
to
perpetuall
imprisonment
yet
thereby
I
was
not
discharged
of
my
alleageance
to
his
Highnes
&
wherupon
he
demaunded
whither
I
thought
his
Highnes
might
not
exact
a
direct
aunswere
of
me
of
such
thinges
as
might
be
demaunded
as
of
any
other
I
aunswered
that
I
thought
his
Highnes
might

Then
said
he
that
like
as
his
Highnes
would
be
gratious
to
them
that
he
found
conformable
so
his
Grace
fullie
determined
to
followe
the
course
of
the
lawe
towardes
such
as
shall
showe
themselves
wilfull
and
obstinate
&
your
demeanure
in
this
matter
maister
More
hath
made
many
so
stife
therein
as
they
be

Whervnto
I
aunswered
that
I
gaue
no
man
occasion
neither
by
worde
nor
writing
to
hold
on
the
one
side
or
the
other

And
for
conclusion
I
would
goe
no
furhter
whatsoever
paine
should
me
befall

For
I
am
the
kinges
true
faithfull
subiect
and
beadsman

I
am
at
the
kinges
pleasure

I
would
to
god
my
death
would
doe
hym
good

Well
maister
More
quoth
maister
Secretarie
report
shalbe
made
to
his
Highnes
and
his
gratious
pleasure
knowne
you
shall
heare
further

So
he
bade
me
farewell

And
so
to
my
Chamber
by
maister
Liefteante
I
was
brought
againe

his
Maieste
thinketh
dothe
muche
touche
his
good
brother
the
Frenche
King

And
that
it
were
very
expedyent
he
had
knowlege
of
the
same

His
hieghnes
hathe
thought
conuenyent
to
write
the

vnto
you
to
thintent
you
maye
declare
them
to
the
quene
of
Navarre
which
his
hieghnes
wold
you
shuld
doo
at
your

The

First
his

of

thenne
growe
to
any

Second
yt

howe
the

Marsselles
dyd
move

lately
by
the

commaundement
to

difficulte
a

Saying

the

Nowe

But

Of

of

howe

to

very
well
to

for

befor

and
before
the

togyther
wherin

me
very
myche
wrong
if

at

your selfes

My
dutye
moste
humbly
remembred
unto
your
Majestie

It
maye
please
the

to
be
advertysed
that
I
have
by
my
servantes
receaved
your
moste
honorable
Letter
the
contentes
wherof
doe
not
a
litle
trouble
me
and
so
much
the
more
for
that
any
of
my
servants
should
move
or
attempte
me
in
matteres
towching
my
sowle
which
I
thinke
the
meaneste
subjecte
within
your
Realme
could
evell
beare
at
their
servantes
hande
havinge
for
my
parte
utterly
refused
heretofor
to
talke
with
them
in
such
matteres
and
of
all
other
persones
leaste
regarded
them
therein
to
whom
I
have
declared
what
I
thinke
as
she
which
trusted
that
your
Majestie
would
have
suffered
me
your
poore
humble
sister
and
beadeswoman
to
have
used
the
accustomed
Masse
which
the
Kinge
your
father
and
myne
with
all
his
predecessores
evermore
used
wherin
also
I
have
been
brought
upp
from
my
youth
and
therunto
my
conscyence
doth
not
only
bynde
me
which
by
noe
meanes
will
suffer
me
to
thinke
one
thing
and
do
another
but
also
the
promise
made
to
the
Emperore
by
your
Majesties
Counsell
was
an
assurance
to
me
that
in
so
doinge
I
should
not
offend
the
Lawes
although
they
seeme
now
to
quallefye
and
deny
the
thing

And
at
my
laste
waytinge
upon
your
Majestie
I
was
so
bould
to
declare
my
mynd
and
conscyence
to
the
same
and
desired
your
Highness
rather
then
you
should
constraine
me
to
leave
the
Masse
to
take
my
life
whereunto
your
Majestie
made
me
a
very
gentle
answere

And
therefore
I
take
it
that
the
matter
in
your
Letter
procedeth
from
such
as
do
wish
those
thinges
to
take
place
which
be
moste
agreeable
to
themselves
by
whose
doinges
(
your
Majestie
not
offended
I
intend
not
to
rule
my
Conscyence

And
thus
without
molestynge
your
Highnes
any
further
I
humblye
beseeche
the
same
ever
for
Gods
sake
to
beare
with
me
as
you
have
done
and
not
to
thinke
that
by
my
doinges
or
ensample
any
inconvenyence
might
growe
to
your
Majestie
or

not

any
such
soarte
puttyng
no

wiche
folowe
the
wiche
hope
dothe
teache
me
in
sainge
that
I
ougth
not
to
doute
but
that
your
Grace
and
the
rest
of
the
Counsel
wil
thinke
that
I
do
it
for
thre
other
consideracions

First
bicause
that
she
hathe
bene
with
me
a
longe
time
and
manye
years
and
hathe
taken
great
labor
and
paine
in
brinkinge
of
me
up
in
lerninge
and
honestie
and
therfore
I
ougth
of
very
dewtye
speke
for
her
for
Saint
Gregorie
sayeth
that
we
ar
more
bounde
to
them
that
bringeth
us
up
wel
than
to
our
parents
for
our
parents
do
that
wiche
is
natural
for
them
that
is
bringeth
us
into
this
Worlde
but
our
brinkers
up
ar
a
cause
to
make
us
live
wel
in
it

The
seconde
is
bicause
I
thinke
that
whatsoever
she
hathe
done
in
my
Lorde
Admirals
matter
as
concerninge
the
marijnge
of
me
she
dide
it
bicause
knowinge
him
to
be
one
of
the
Counsel
she
thogth
he
wolde
not
go
about
any
suche
thinge
without
he
had
the
Counsels
consent
therunto
for
I
have
harde
her
manye
times
say
that
she
wolde
never
have
me
mary
in
any
place
without
your
Graces
and
the
Counsels
consente

The
thirde
cause
is
bicause
that
it
shal
and
doth
make
men
thinke
that
I
am
not
clere
of
the
dide
myselfe
but
that
it
is
pardoned
in
me
bicause
of
my
youthe
bicause
that
she
I
loved
so
wel
is
in
suche
a
place

Thus
hope
prevailinge
more
with
me
than
fear
hath
won
the
battle
and
I
have
at
this
time
gone
furth
with
it

Frome
Hatfilde
this
7
day
of
Marche

Also
if
I
may
be
so
bolde
not
offendinge
I
beseche
your
Grace
and
the
rest
of
the
Counsel
to
be
good
to
master
Aschiley
her
husbonde
wiche
bicause
he
is
my
kindesman
I
wold
be
glad
he
shulde
do
well

Counsell

MADAM
Although
we
heare
that
since
the
death
of
your
husband
our
late
Ambassador
S=r=
Thomas
Hoby
you
have
received
in
France
great
and
comfortable
courtesyes
from
the
French
King
the
Queen
Mother
the
Queen
of
Navarre
and
sundry
others
yet
we
made
accompt
that
all
these
layd
together
cannot
so
satisfye
you
as
some
testimony
and
sparke
of
our
favour
with
the
application
of
the
late
service
of
your
Husband
and
of
your
own
demeanour
there
wherefore
though
you
shall
receive
it
somewhat
lately
in
time
yet
we
assure
you
the
same
proceedeth
only
of
the
late
knowledge
of
your
return

And
therefore
we
let
you
know
that
the
service
of
your
Husband
was
to
us
so
acceptable
as
next
yourself
and
your
children
we
have
not
the
meanest
loss
of
so
able
a
Servant
in
that
calling

And
yet
since
it
hath
so
pleased
God
to
call
him
in
the
entry
of
this
our
Service
we
take
it
in
the
better
part
seeing
it
hath
appeared
to
be
Gods
pleasure
to
call
him
away
so
favourably
to
the
service
of
him
especially
in
the
constancy
of
his
duty
towards
God
wherein
we
hear
say
he
dyed
very
commendably

And
so
we
would
have
you
to
rest
yourself
in
quietness
with
a
firm
opinion
of
our
especiall
favour
towards
you

Given
under
our
Signet
at
our
City
of
Oxford

September
1566
the
eight
year
of
our
Reign

Your
loving
Friend
ELIZABETH
R.
MADAME
Although
the
necessity
of
my
cause
(
which
makith
me
to
be
importune
to
you
do
make
you
to
judge
that
I
am
out
of
the
way
yet
such
as
have
not
my
passion
nor
the
respects
wherof
you
ar
perswaded
will
think
that
I
do
as
my
cause
doth
requyre

Madame
I
have
not
accused
you
neither
in
wordes
nor
in
thought
to
have
usid
your self
evell
towardes
me
and
I
beleeve
that
you
have
no
want
of
good
understanding
to
keepe
you
from
perswasion
against
your
naturall
good
inclynation

But
in
the
meane
tyme
I
cannot
chose
(
having
my
senses
but
perceive
very
evell
furderance
in
my
matters
sence
my
comming
hither

I
thought
that
I
had
sufficiently
discourcid
unto
yow
the
discommodities
which
this
delay
bringeth
unto
me

And
spetially
that
they
think
in
this
next
moneth
of
August
to
hold
a
Parlement
against
me
and
all
my
servants

And
in
the
meane
tyme
I
am
stayde
heere
and
yet
will
you
that
I
shuld
put
my
self
further
into
your
Contrey
(
without
seeing
you
and
remoove
me
further
from
myne
and
there
to
do
me
this
dishonnor
at
the
requestes
of
my
Rebelles
as
to
send
Commissioners
to
heere
theim
against
me
as
you
wold
do
to
a
meane
subject
and
not
heere
me
by
mouth

But
being
not
so
I
cannot
accept
this
dishonnor
at
their
handes
that
being
in
possession
they
will
comme
and
accuse
me
before
your
Commissioners
wherof
I
cannot
lyke

And
seeing
you
think
it
to
be
against
your
honor
and
cousynage
to
do
otherwise
I
beseech
you
that
you
will
not
be
myne
enemye
untill
you
may
see
how
I
can
discharge
my
self
every
waye

And
to
suffre
me
to
go
into
France
where
I
have
a
dowery
to
mainteyn
me
or
at
the
least
to
go
into
Scotland
with
assurance
that
if
there
come
any
strangers
thither
I
will
bynd
my
self
for
their
retourne
without
any
prejudice
to
you

Or
if
it
please
you
not
to
do
thus
I
protest
that
I
will
not
impute
it
to
falshode
if
I
receyve
strangers
in
my
contrey
wythout
makyng
you
any
other
discharge
for
it

Do
with
my
body
at
your
will
the
honnor
or
blame
shalbe
yours

For
I
had
rather
dy
heere
and
that
my
faythfull
servants
may
be
succourid
(
though
you
wold
not
so
by
strangers
then
to
suffer
theim
to
be
utterly
undon
upon
h
to
receyve
in
tyme
to
come
particuler
commodite

There
be
many
things
that
moove
me
to
feare
that
I
shall
have
to
doo
in
this
contrey
with
other
then
with
yow

But
forasmuch
as
nothing
hath
followed
upon
my
last
mone
I
hold
my
peace

This
hath
ben
refusid
me
by
my
Lord
Scroope
and
M=r=
Knolles
(
as
they
say
by
your
commandement
because
I
wold
not
depart
hence
to
your
charge
untill
I
had
answer
of
this
Lettre
though
I
shewed
them
that
yow
requyred
my
answer
upon
the
two
pointz
conteyned
in
your
Lettre

Th'one
is
(
to
let
you
breefly
understand
them
I
am
come
to
you
to
make
my
mone
to
you
the
which
being
heard
I
would
declare
unto
you
myne
innocency
and
then
requyre
your
ayde

And
for
lack
therof
I
cannot
but
make
my
mone
and
complaint
to
God
that
I
am
not
heard
in
my
just
quarell
and
to
appele
to
other
Princes
to
have
respect
therunto
as
my
case
requyreth
and
to
you
Madame
first
of
all
when
you
shall
have
examynid
your
conscience
before
and
have
him
for
witnes
and
th'other
which
is
to
come
further
into
your
Contrey
and
not
to
come
to
your
presence
I
will
esteeme
that
as
no
favor
but
will
take
it
for
the
contrary
obeying
it
as
a
thing
forced

In
the
meane
tyme
I
beseech
yow
to
retourne
to
me
my
Lord
Heris
for
I
cannot
be
without
him
having
none
of
my
counsell
heere
and
also
to
suffre
me
if
it
please
you
without
further
delay
to
depart
hence
whither
so
ever
it
be
out
of
this
Contree

I
am
sure
you
will
not
deny
me
this
simple
request
for
your
honor's
sake
seing
it
doth
not
please
you
to
use
your
naturall
goodnes
towards
me
otherways

And
seeing
that
of
myne
accord
I
am
come
hither
let
me
depart
againe
with
yours

And
if
God
permit
my
causes
to
succeede
well
I
shalbe
bownd
to
you
for
it
and
happeninge
otherwise
yet
I
cannot
blame
you

As
for
my
lord
Flemin
seeing
that
upon
my
credit
you
have
suffred
him
to
goo
home
to
his
house
I
warrant
you
he
shall
passe
no
further
but
shall
retoorne
when
it
shall
please
you

For
I
have
left
them
in
charge
to
have
more
respect
to
my
servants
and
to
myne
estat
then
to
my
life
Good
suster
be
of
an
other
mynde

Wyn
the
hart
and
all
shalbe
yours
and
at
your
commandment

I
thought
to
satisfy
you
holely
if
I
might
have
seene
you

Alas
do
not
as
the
serpent
that
stoppeth
his
heering
for
I
am
no
inchanter
but
your
suster
and
naturall
cousyne

If
Cesar
had
not
disdaynid
to
heere
or
reede
the
complaint
of
an
advertiser
he
had
not
so
dyed

Why
should
Prince's
eares
be
stopped
seeing
they
are
payntid
so
long
meaning
that
they
shuld
heere
all
and
be
well
advised
before
they
answer

I
am
not
of
the
nature
of
the
basilisk
and
lesse
of
the
camelions
to
turne
you
to
my
lykenesse
and
though
I
shuld
be
so
dangerouse
and
curst
as
men
say
yow
ar
sufficiently
armyd
with
constance
and
with
justice
which
I
requyre
of
God
who
give
you
grace
to
use
it
well
with
longe
and
happy
life

the
Turkishe
embassadowr
for
the
confirmation
of
the
peace
who
is
by
nation
a
dutche
man
borne
in
Bavier
the
Turkes
principall
interpretour
named
amonge
them
Mehemet
Beck

This
Cowrrier
hathe
broughte
news
from
Constantinople
that
the
Turkes
navie
is
safe
returned
which
he
will
encreace
the
nexte
yeere
withe
a
hundred
gallies
for
to
invade
Sicill

By
the
way
Petro
Portocarrero
Capteine
of
the
Gollett
is
deceassed

In
my
simple
opinion
they
have
bene
provoked
by
the
Portugese
to
take
this
matter
fur
above
their
forces
uppon
them
for
that
the
Turke
by
the
redde
sea
dothe
greatlie
encroche
uppon
their
Indian
traffick

The
expectation
of
these
embassadowrs
will
cawse
the
Emperowr
to
delay
his
journey
to
Bohemia
whiche
notwithestandinge
he
muste
necessarily
ere

be
longe
performe
they
beinge
very
evill
contente
of
his
so
longe
absence
in
so
muche
that
this
yeere
they
have
plainely
refused
to
give
certaine
greate
summes
of
money
whiche
heretofore
they
had
not
denied

Besides
that
he
muste
please
them
for
to
gett
his
son
the
crowne
for
althoughe
he
do
pretende

they
will
not

any
other
waie

in

In

be

To
the
Worshipful
his
very
singular
good
friend
Maister
G
of
Trinitie
Hall
in
Cambridge

Good
Master
G

I
perceiue
by
your
most
curteous
and
frendly
Letters
your
good
will
to
be
no
lesse
in
deed
than
I
alwayes
esteemed

In
recompence
wherof
think
I
beseech
you
that
I
wil
spare
neither
speech
nor
wryting
nor
aught
else
whensoeuer
and
wheresoeuer
occasion
shal
be
offred
me
yea
I
will
not
stay
till
it
be
offred
but
will
seeke
it
in
al
that
possibly
I
may

And
that
you
may
perceiue
how
much
your
Counsel
in
al
things
preuaileth
with
me
and
how
altogither
I
am
ruled
and
ouer-ruled
thereby
I
am
now
determined
to
alter
mine
owne
former
purpose
and
to
subscribe
to
your
aduizement
beinge
notwithstanding
resolued
stil
to
abide
your
farther
resolution

My
principal
doubts
are
these

First
I
was
minded
for
a
while
to
haue
intermitted
the
vttering
of
my
writings
leaste
by
ouer-much
cloying
their
noble
eares
I
should
gather
a
contempt
of
my
self
or
else
seeme
rather
for
gaine
and
commoditie
to
doe
it
for
some
sweetnesse
that
I
haue
already
tasted

Then
also
me
seemeth
the
work
too
base
for
his
excellent
Lordship
being
made
in
Honour
of
a
priuate
Personage
unknowne
which
of
some
yl-willers
might
be
vpbraided
not
to
be
so
worthie
as
you
knowe
she
is
or
the
matter
not
so
weightie
that
it
should
be
offred
to
so
weightie
a
Personage
or
the
like

And
indeede
for
your
selfe
to
it
sitteth
with
you
now
to
call
your
wits
and
senses
togither
(
which
are
alwaies
at
call
when
occasion
is
so
fairely
offered
of
Estimation
and
Preferment

For
whiles
the
yron
is
hote
it
is
good
striking
and
minds
of
Nobles
varie
as
their
Estates

Verum

quid
durius

I
pray
you
bethinke
you
well
hereof

R.
My
very
good
Lord
I
now
remain
aboard
the
Bear
and
as
yet
the
provisions
for
the
ships
could
not
be
taken
all
in
by
reason
of
the
weather
which
hath
been
so
tempestuous
as
that
no
boats
could
lie
aboard
them
to
put
in
the
same
yet
I
hope
that
within
two
or
three
days
all
things
will
be
in
a
readiness

Here
is
a
very
sufficient
and
able
company
of
sailors
as
ever
were
seen
and
because
their
long
journeys
out
of
all
places
of
this
realm
and
this
bad
season
makes
them
unprovided
of
apparel
and
such
necessaries
it
were
good
for
their
relief
to
pay
them
one
month's
wages
before
hand

Many
great
charges
extraordinary
hath
grown
this
quarter
which
I
could
hardly
have
believed
unless
with
mine
own
eyes
and
good
examination
I
had
seen

Wherefore
in
respect
of
those
causes
and
for
the
furtherance
of
service
I
am
to
entreat
your
good
Lordship
to
give
order
that
the
rest
of
the
warrant
lately
granted
for
the
whole
navy
may
be
paid
to
Mr
Hawkyns
and
2.000
more
upon
the
old
warrant
of
29.000
for
the
furnishing
of
those
extraordinary
charges
wherein
your
Lordship
shall
further
a
good
service

We
have
entered
into
sea
victuals
this
day
being
the
22nd
of
this
instant
December
and
not
before
for
the
preserving
of
the
six
weeks'
victuals

And
so
I
bid
your
good
lordship
most
heartily
farewell

From
aboard
the
Bear
the
22d
of
December
1587

Your
Lordship's
most
assured
loving
friend
to
command
C

Howard

My
honourable
good
Lord
I
do
understand
by
Mr.
Cæsar
how
much
I
am
bound
unto
your
Lordship
for
your
honourable
favour

I
have
no
ways
to
recompense
it
but
with
my
love
and
service
which
your
Lordship
shall
be
most
assured
ever
of

It
may
be
there
hath
been
some
report
made
to
your
lorship
of
some
chance
that
happened
here
before
my
coming
down
by
fire
iN
one
of
the
ships
and
because
I
do
understand
that
it
is
reported
that
it
should
be
done
by
Ascott
I
do
assure
your
Lordship
it
was
after
this
manner

There
were
two
poor
knaves
that
came
from
Westchester
that
strived
for
a
place
to
hang
up
their
netting
for
to
lie
in
and
the
one
of
them
had
a
piece
of
a
candle
in
his
hand
and
in
strving
the
candle
fell
down
where
there
lay
some
oakum

I
am
bold
to
send
you
by
this
bearer
my
man
the
copy
of
a
proclamation
which
I
have
drawn
and
proclaimed
in
my
own
ship
and
shall
be
this
day
and
drawer
of
a
proclamation
but
it
shall
serve
I
hope
for
to
prevent
some
ill
that
might
happen

My
good
Lord
this
bearer
my
man
shall
always
attend
at
the
court
and
shall
attend
on
your
Lordship
always
to
know
your
pleasure
if
you
will
command
him
anything
unto
me

And
so
resting
always
most
beholden
unto
your
Lordship
and
most
ready
to
do
your
Lordship
any
service
I
humbly
take
my
leave

Aboard
her
Majesty's
good
ship
the
White
Bear
the
24th
of
December
1587

Your
Lordship's
most
assured
to
command
C

Howard

My
honourable
and
good
Lord
--
I
have
received
your
Lordship's
favourable
letter
and
am
much
bound
unto
your
Lordship
for
your
Lordship's
favours

I
would
to
God
your
Lordship's
health
and
strength
were
answerable
to
your
mind
then
I
am
sure
this
company
here
with
me
should
be
happy
to
see
your
Lordship
here

My
Lord
we
can
bring
all
the
ships
that
her
Majesty
hath
aground
there
in
3
springs

I
know
not
that
we
can
do
so
in
any
place
else
but
here
at
Chatham

That
which
is
a-doing
above
the
town
will
be
to
very
good
purpose
for
any
sudden
attack
and
for
my
part
I
wish
it
were
as
strong
as
Flushing

I
received
a
letter
from
my
Lord
Cobham
of
an
enterprise
that
is
sent
down
to
burn
all
such
ships
of
her
Majesty's
as
shall
ride
before
the
Rammekens
or
thereabouts

I
received
this
letter
as
I
was
half
the
way
comng
homewards
from
Harwich

I
presently
sent
away
a
pinnace
with
John
Wynter
in
her
your
Lordship's
servant
and
did
send
the
advertisement
unto
Sir
William
Russell
with
a
letter
of
my
own
and
likewise
I
did
write
unto
the
captains
of
her
Majesty's
ships
with
certain
instructions
which
if
the
device
be
attempted
I
believe
you
shall
hear
they
shall
smart
for
their
device

There
is
two
ships
and
a
pinnace
their
victuals
cometh
out
about
an
eight
days
hence
so
that
then
they
will
come
away

In
the
meantime
if
nothing
be
done
already
I
doubt
not
but
they
shall
safely
come
away

Your
Lordship's
most
assured
always
to
command
C

Howard

Sir
I
most
humbly
thank
you
for
your
letters

I
cannot
tell
what
to
think
of
my
brother
Stafford's
advertisement
for
if
it
be
true
that
the
King
of
Spain's
forces
be
dissolved
I
would
not
wish
the
Queen's
Majesty
to
be
at
this
charges
that
she
is
at
but
if
it
be
but
a
device
knowing
that
a
little
thing
maketh
us
too
careless
then
I
know
not
what
may
come
of
it

But
this
I
am
sure
of
if
her
Majesty
would
have
spent
but
a
1,000
crowns
to
have
had
some
intelligence
it
would
have
saved
her
twenty
times
as
much

Assure
yourself
he
knoweth
what
we
do
here
and
if
the
army
be
or
do
dissolve
it
is
the
preparation
that
her
Majesty
hath
made
that
is
the
cause
for
he
cannot
abide
this
heat
that
is
provided
for
him

He
did
never
think
that
he
would
thus
have
provided
for
his
coming
but
that
the
number
of
false
alarums
that
he
hath
given
her
Majesty
would
have
made
her
to
have
taken
no
alarum
and
so
to
have
had
the
vantage
and
the
chopping
up
of
his
friends
here
I
am
sure
he
doth
not
like
and
if
they
be
up
I
wish
they
should
continue
so
till
there
be
a
good
peace
which
I
pray
to
God
to
send
us

Sir
if
your
next
advertisements
do
assure
the
dissolving
of
the
army
in
Spain
then
it
were
good
we
did
so
here
yet
if
the
Duke
of
Parma
continue
his
and
that
there
be
any
doubt
of
anything
intended
for
Scotland
put
but
three
or
four
more
ships
to
them
in
the
Narrow
Seas
and
I
dare
assure
you
it
shall
beat
any
power
he
shall
be
able
to
make
and
impeach
him
of
any
attempt
in
Scotland
and
I
will
take
upon
me
the
service
myself
for
I
assure
you
it
doth
grieve
me
to
see
her
majesty
at
more
charges
than
is
needful
and
this
charge
will
not
be
great

And
so
I
pray
you
to
write
me
frankly
for
I
do
assure
you
I
will
take
it
kindly
and
friendly
at
your
hands
and
think
myself
much
beholden
unto
you
for
it
for
I
may
sometimes
upon
a
good
conceit
in
my
opinion
make
such
a
journey
as
I
did
now
to
Harwich
and
yet
it
may
not
be
so
well
taken
there
but
I
know
no
cause
why
it
should
be
but
well
taken

I
do
assure
you
on
my
honour
it
cost
not
the
Queen's
Majesty
one
halfpenny
nor
shall
not
when
I
make
any
such
journey

I
will
rather
spend
myself
one
hundred
pounds
than
to
spend
her
one
penny

Thus
good
Mr.
Secretary
I
am
bold
with
you
as
my
special
good
friend
and
so
bid
you
most
heartily
farewell
and
God
send
you
health
and
strength

From
the
Bear
the
24th
of
January

Your
assured
loving
friend
to
use
C

Howard

Sir
I
most
heartily
thank
you
for
your
letter
and
for
your
advertisements

There
happened
a
mischance
in
one
of
his
ships
at
Portsmouth
that
a
piece
broke
and
killed
a
man
with
some
other
hurt

If
you
would
write
a
word
or
two
unto
him
to
spare
his
powder
it
would
do
well

Sir
I
send
you
herewith
enclosed
all
the
copies
of
the
letters
from
my
Lord
Chamberlain
again
which
I
most
heartily
thank
you
for
and
I
pray
to
God
the
Scottish
King
do
deceive
me
but
I
am
afeared
he
will
not

For
my
own
part
I
have
made
of
the
French
King
the
Scottish
King
and
the
King
of
spain
a
Trinity
that
I
mean
never
to
trust
to
be
saved
by
and
I
would
others
were
in
that
of
my
opinion

Sir
there
was
never
since
England
was
England
such
a
stratagem
and
mask
made
to
deceive
England
withal
as
this
is
of
the
treaty
of
peace

I
pray
God
we
have
not
cause
to
remember
one
thing
that
was
made
of
the
Scots
by
the
Englishmen
that
we
do
not
curse
for
this
a
long
grey
beard
with
a
white
head
witless
that
will
make
all
the
world
think
us
heartless

You
know
whom
I
mean

I
have
received
a
letter
from
Sir
Henry
Palmer
that
there
is
at
Dunkirk
divers
hoys
and
lighters
that
be
filled
with
ballast
and
great
stones
surely
means
for
the
stopping
of
some
haven

Sir
if
there
be
at
any
time
any
matter
of
importance
wherein
I
may
do
any
service
there
with
you
I
can
be
quickly
there
and
here
again

I
pray
you
Sir
let
it
be
thought
on
as
you
see
cause
upon
your
advertisements
it
will
ask
a
good
time
to
furnish
our
fleet
again
with
men
as
they
were

I
do
not
look
to
see
it
ever
bettered

I
pray
God
it
be
as
well
when
there
shall
be
cause

And
so
giving
you
most
hearty
thanks
for
your
most
friendly
dealing
with
me
in
all
causes
and
your
friendly
remembrance
I
bid
you
most
heartily
farewell

From
aboard
her
Majesty's
good
ship
the
White
Bear
the
27th
of
January
1587

Your
assured
loving
friend
C

HOWARD

He
hath
the
charge
of
all
my
soldiers
in
my
ship
and
hath
done
his
duty
very
well

I
hope
he
will
answer
all
honestly
and
well

Sir
if
the
Commissioners
be
once
gone
over
and
that
there
be
a
surcease
of
arms
it
shall
be
but
folly
and
to
no
purpose
for
me
to
lie
here

I
think
both
I
and
the
noblemen
leaving
sufficient
lieutenants
in
our
ships
and
the
officers
as
Sir
W.
Wynter
Mr.
Hawkyns
and
Mr.
Borough
remain
here
with
the
navy
will
be
sufficient
for
before
these
ships
can
have
their
full
number
of
men
again
it
will
be
a
month
to
gather
them
do
what
we
can

And
I
pray
to
God
we
have
them
when
we
shall
need
for
many
are
gone
abroad
and
specially
the
chiefest
men
God
send
me
to
see
such
a
company
together
again
when
need
is

I
protest
it
before
God
I
write
not
this
to
you
because
I
am
weary
with
being
here
for
if
it
were
not
for
her
Majesty's
presence
I
had
rather
live
in
the
company
of
these
noble
ships
than
in
any
place

And
yet
would
I
be
glad
that
there
were
something
to
do

I
am
more
sorrier
for
the
noblemen
than
any
ways
for
myself
for
I
would
have
them
save
to
spend
when
need
shall
be

I
think
it
will
be
a
most
fittest
time
to
ground
our
ships
in
for
now
at
our
coming
out
it
was
you
know
on
such
a
sudden
as
we
could
not
ground
but
two
or
three
of
the
middle
sort
so
as
the
great
ships
were
not
grounded

I
have
with
the
advice
of
the
officers
and
masters
thought
good
to
begin
with
some
the
next
spring
and
so
in
a
three
springs
dispatch
them
all
and
have
them
all
in
most
excellent
order
by
the
midst
of
March
all
save
the
men
and
I
doubt
not
but
the
ships
shall
prove
some
notable
liars
and
if
cause
fall
out
do
a
better
day
of
service
for
England
than
ever
ships
did
for
it
yet

But
this
assure
yourself
if
the
forces
of
Spain
do
come
before
the
midst
of
April
there
will
be
as
much
ado
to
have
men
to
furnish
us
as
ever
was
but
men
must
have
or
else
the
ships
will
do
no
good

God
knows
it
is
but
a
bare
sight
to
see
us
now
to
that
it
was
and
I
would
not
wish
any
to
take
the
pains
to
come
to
see
us
till
we
are
newly
supplied
when
cause
shall
be

Sir
God
send
you
well
to
do
and
continuance
of
your
health
and
so
I
bid
you
most
heartily
farewell

From
aboard
her
Majesty's
good
ship
the
Bear
the
28th
of
January

Your
assured
loving
friend
C

HOWARD

For
Mr.
Hawkyns'
bargain
he
is
presently
to
repair
to
the
Court
where
he
shall
be
best
able
to
answer
in
his
own
defence
but
this
much
I
will
say
to
your
Lordship
I
have
been
aboard
of
every
ship
that
goeth
out
with
me
and
in
every
place
where
any
may
creep
and
I
do
thank
God
that
they
be
in
the
estate
they
be
in
and
there
is
never
a
one
of
them
that
knows
what
a
leak
means

I
have
known
when
an
Admiral
of
England
hath
gone
out
and
two
ships
in
fleet
could
not
say
so

There
is
none
that
goeth
out
now
but
I
durst
go
to
the
Rio
de
la
Plata
in
her
and
yet
the
Mary
Rose
and
the
Swallow
be
with
me
who
were
ships
in
the
King's
Majesty's
her
father's
time

And
therefore
I
dare
presume
greatly
that
those
that
have
been
made
in
her
Majesty's
time
be
very
good
and
serviceable
and
shall
prove
them
arrant
liars
that
have
reported
the
contrary

And
I
thank
God
her
Majesty
I
hope
may
be
well
assured
of
their
goodness
yet
everything
hath
his
time
and
must
be
helped
as
need
requireth

My
Lord
I
had
no
meaning
to
carry
away
all
the
officers

I
have
none
with
me
but
Sir
W.
Wynter

I
leave
Mr.
Hawkyns
and
Mr.
Borough
behind
to
wait
on
your
Lordship
and
to
put
the
four
great
ships
in
readiness
which
we
shall
greatly
need
if
the
Spanish
forces
come
out

Your
Lordship's
most
assured
to
command
C

HOWARD

The
absence
of
my
Lord
Admiral
most
gracious
Sovereign
hath
emboldened
me
to
put
my
pen
to
the
paper

On
Friday
last
upon
good
consideration
we
left
the
army
of
Spain
so
far
to
the
northwards
as
they
could
neither
recover
England
nor
Scotland

And
within
three
days
after
we
were
entertained
with
a
great
storm
considering
the
time
of
the
year
the
which
storm
in
many
of
your
judgments
hath
not
a
little
annoyed
the
enemy's
army

If
the
wind
hinder
it
not
I
think
they
are
forced
to
Denmark
and
that
for
divers
causes

Certain
it
is
that
many
of
their
people
were
sick
and
not
a
few
killed

Their
ships
sails
ropes
and
masts
needeth
great
reparations
for
that
they
had
all
felt
of
your
Majesty's
force

Your
Highness's
enemies
are
many
yet
God
hath
and
will
hear
your
Majesty's
prayers
putting
your
hand
to
the
plough
for
the
defence
of
his
truth
as
your
Majesty
hath
begun

God
for
his
christ's
sake
bless
your
sacred
Majesty
now
and
ever

Written
aboard
your
Majesty's
very
good
ship
the
Revenge
this
8th
of
August
1588

Your
Majesty's
faithful
vassal
FRA.
DRAKE

Most
Honourable
The
army
of
Spain
I
think
certainly
to
be
put
either
with
Norway
or
Denmark

There
are
divers
causes
which
moveth
me
so
to
think

The
first
we
understand
by
divers
prisoners
which
we
have
taken
that
generally
through
all
their
whole
fleet
there
was
no
one
ship
free
of
sick
people

Secondly
their
ships
masts
sails
and
ropes
were
very
much
decayed
and
spoiled
by
our
great
shot

And
I
assure
myself
that
whensoever
her
Majesty
shall
hear
of
their
arrival
in
any
of
these
coasts
that
her
Highness
shall
be
advertised
both
of
their
great
distress
and
of
no
small
loss
amongst
them
for
I
assure
your
Honour
her
Majesty's
good
ships
felt
much
of
that
storm
and
lost
many
of
their
boats
and
pinnaces
with
some
anchors
and
cables
yet
were
we
fair
by
our
own
shore
and
the
wind
right
off
the
land

Some
amongst
us
will
not
let
to
say
that
they
are
in
Scotland

I
cannot
think
so
for
that
we
had
no
wind
whereby
they
were
able
to
recover
any
place
of
the
mainland
of
Scotland
without
it
were
some
of
the
out
isles
which
are
no
meet
places
to
relieve
their
so
many
great
wants

Norway
or
the
out
isles
of
Scotland
can
relieve
them
but
with
water
and
a
few
cows
or
bad
beef
and
some
small
quantity
of
goats
and
hens
which
is
to
them
as
nothing

And
yet
these
bad
reliefs
are
to
be
had
but
in
few
places
and
their
roads
dangerous

The
only
thing
which
is
to
be
looked
for
is
that
if
they
should
go
to
the
King
of
Denmark
and
there
have
his
friendship
and
help
for
all
their
reliefs
none
can
better
help
their
wants
in
all
these
parts
than
he
for
that
he
is
a
Prince
of
great
shipping
and
can
best
supply
his
wants
which
now
the
Duke
of
Medina
the
Sidonia
standeth
in
need
of
as
great
anchors
cables
masts
ropes
and
victuals
and
what
the
King
of
Spain's
hot
crowns
will
do
in
cold
countries
for
mariners
and
men
I
leave
to
your
good
Lordship
which
can
best
judge
thereof

We
left
a
pinnace
of
her
Majesty's
the
Advice
and
a
fine
caravel
of
my
own
to
attend
the
fleet
of
Spain
when
we
left
them
but
what
is
become
of
them
in
that
great
storm
or
whether
they
may
be
stayed
in
any
other
country
as
they
may
I
know
not

My
poor
opinion
is
that
it
were
most
meet
to
send
a
good
ship
and
some
fine
bark
with
some
very
sufficient
person
to
deal
effectually
from
her
Majesty
with
the
King
of
Denmark
as
he
shall
find
the
cause
to
require
and
to
send
the
true
report
back
with
all
speed
possible
that
they
may
be
the
better
prevented
for
no
doubt
but
that
which
they
are
able
to
do
they
will
presently
put
it
in
execution

The
Prince
of
Parma
I
take
him
to
be
as
a
bear
robbed
of
her
whelps
and
no
doubt
but
being
so
great
a
soldier
as
he
is
that
he
will
presently
if
he
may
undertake
some
great
matter
for
his
rest
will
stand
now
thereupon

It
is
for
certain
that
the
Duke
of
sidonia
standeth
somewhat
jealous
of
him
and
the
Spaniards
begin
to
hate
him
their
honour
being
touched
so
near
many
of
their
lives
spent--I
assure
your
Honour
not
so
little
as
five
thousand
men
less
than
when
first
we
saw
them
near
Plymouth
divers
of
their
ships
sunk
and
taken
and
they
have
nothing
to
say
for
themselves
in
excuse
but
that
they
came
to
the
place
appointed
which
was
at
Calais
and
there
stayed
the
Duke
of
Parma's
coming
above
24
hours
yea
and
until
they
were
fired
thence

So
this
is
my
poor
conclusion

If
we
may
recover
near
Dunkirk
this
night
or
to-morrow
morning
so
as
their
power
may
see
us
returned
from
the
chase
and
ready
to
encounter
them
if
they
once
sally
that
the
next
news
you
shall
hear
will
be
the
one
to
mutiny
against
the
other
which
when
that
shall
come
to
pass
or
whether
they
mutiny
or
no
let
us
all
with
one
consent
both
high
and
low
magnify
and
praise
our
most
gracious
and
merciful
God
for
his
infinite
and
unspeakable
goodness
towards
us
which
I
protest
to
your
good
Lordships
that
my
belief
is
that
our
most
gracious
Sovereign
her
poor
subjects
and
the
Church
of
God
hath
opened
the
heavens
in
divers
places
and
pierced
the
ears
of
our
most
merciful
father
unto
whom
in
Christ
Jesu
be
all
honour
and
glory

so
be
it
Amen
Amen

Written
with
much
haste
for
that
we
are
ready
to
set
sail
to
prevent
the
Duke
of
Parma
this
southerly
wind
if
it
please
God
for
truly
my
poor
opinion
is
that
we
should
have
a
great
eye
unto
him

From
her
Majesty's
very
good
ship

Revenge

10th

Your
Honour's
faithfully
to
be
commanded

Yet
would
I
willingly
see
it

Your
Honour's
ever
FRA.
DRAKE

Most
Honourable
The
sudden
sending
for
of
my
very
good
Lord
my
Lord
Admiral
hath
caused
me
to
scribble
these
few
lines

First
most
humbly
beseeching
your
Honour
to
deliver
this
letter
unto
her
Majesty
as
a
testification
of
my
Lord
Amiral's
most
honourable
using
of
me
in
this
action
where
it
hath
pleased
his
good
Lordship
to
accept
of
that
which
I
have
sometimes
spoken
and
commended
that
little
service
which
I
was
able
much
better
than
in
either
of
them
both
I
was
able
to
deserve

Wherein
if
I
have
not
performed
as
much
as
was
looked
for
yet
I
persuade
myself
his
good
Lordship
will
confess
I
have
been
dutiful

Touching
any
other
causes
that
either
hath
been
done
or
is
to
be
done
let
me
pray
pardon
of
your
Honour
for
I
assure
your
Honour
that
my
Lord
Admiral
hath
so
sufficiently
instructed
himself
daily
as
I
faithfully
believe
his
good
Lordship
will
thoroughly
satisfy
her
Majesty
and
your
Honours
what
is
now
best
to
be
done

Thus
humbly
taking
my
leave
I
beseech
God
to
bless
the
work
of
her
Majesty's
hands
always

Written
aboard
her
Majesty's
good
ship
the
Revenge
at
midnight
this
11th
of
August
1588

Which
reports
are
quite
contrary

My
poor
opinion
is
that
if
their
fleet
chance
to
return
it
is
altogether
for
that
the
wind
will
not
permit
them
good
passage
to
go
about
the
other
way
at
this
time
of
the
year
because
it
is
most
subject
to
westerly
winds

This
wind
that
now
bloweth
if
it
be
not
more
easterly
there
than
it
is
here
could
hardly
permit
such
a
fleet
for
that
they
shall
feel
a
great
wind
for
to
set
sail
to
pass
on
the
back
side
of
Scotland
and
Ireland
which
may
be
the
cause
that
of
necessity
they
must
be
forced
this
way
for
Spain

Farther
my
judgment
is
that
the
Duke
of
Sidonia
with
his
fleet
shall
needs
jump
with
fair
weather
the
highest
of
a
spring
with
good
wind
and
the
Duke
of
Parma
embarKing
all
in
one
day

This
were
very
meet
for
them
for
if
any
one
of
these
fail
them
they
shall
never
perform
as
much
as
they
have
promised
to
the
King
their
master

My
reason
is
this

The
most
part
of
the
ships
of
the
Duke
of
Parma
are
small
and
being
pestered
with
men
of
war
must
of
necessity
have
fair
weather
and
--
as
I
am
credibly
given
to
understand
--
they
must
have
a
spring
to
bring
their
shipping
both
out
of
Dunkirk
Nieuport
and
Sluys

Now
for
the
Duke
of
medina
his
fleet
there
is
no
harbour
for
them
upon
that
coast
so
that
to
stir
it
requireth
fair
weather
which
when
it
happen
that
we
should
find
there
he
is
like
God
willing
to
have
unquiet
rest

I
would
advertise
your
Honour
of
some
defects
in
her
Majesty's
army
but
that
my
very
good
Lord
the
Lord
Admiral
hath
written
unto
your
Honour
thereof
at
large

This
is
my
poor
opinion
of
her
Majesty's
army
that
the
threatening
of
the
enemy
will
put
a
great
part
of
their
weakness
from
her
Majesty's
good
subjects
and
no
doubt
but
they
will
fight
valiantly

although
I
find
my
Lord
Admiral
well
affected
when
fair
weather
is
to
go
for
the
coast
of
Flanders
yet
I
would
your
Honour
should
animate
us
forward
for
there
are
many
causes
that
might
move
us
to
be
there
more
than
we
are
and
much
better
for
us
and
better
service

Thus
humbly
taking
my
leave
of
your
Honour
I
rest
desiring
God
to
give
us
all
grace
to
live
in
his
fear
so
shall
we
not
need
greatly
to
fear
the
enemy

From
aboard
her
Majesty's
very
good
ship
the
Revenge
this
23rd
of
August
1588

Your
Honour's
most
willing
to
be
commanded

DRAKE

I
have
sent
to
your
Honour
a
copy
Englished
out
of
a
letter
sent
from
Don
Pedro
de
Valdes
to
the
King
his
master
which
doth
deliver
the
time
of
their
victualling
and
of
some
discontentment
which
was
between
the
Duke
and
him

Let
me
humbly
beseech
your
Honour
that
we
may
be
put
in
mind
here
that
it
were
good
we
saw
the
coast
of
Flanders
as
often
as
we
might

God
bless
us
all
and
give
us
grace
to
fear
his
justice

I
crave
pardon

I
have
no
time
to
read
that
which
I
have
caused
to
be

is
as
well
able
to
bombast
out
a
blanke-verse
as
the
best
of
you
and
in
a
countrey

Oh
that
I
might
intreat
your
rare
wittes
to
bee
imployed
in
more
profitable
courses
and
let
these
apes
imitate
your
past
excellence
and
neuer
more
acquaynte
them
with
your
admyred
inuentions

I
knowe
the
best
husband
of
you
all
will
neuer
prooue
an
usurer
and
the
kindest
of
them
all
will
neuer
prooue
a
kinde
nurse
yet
whilst
you
may
seeke
your
better
maisters
for
it
is
pitty
men
of
such
rare
wits
should
bee
subiect
to
the
pleasures
of
such
rude
groomes

In
this
I
might
insert
two
more
that
both
haue
writte
against
these
buckram
gentlemen
but
let
their
owne
worke
serue
to
witnesse
against
theyr
owne
wickednesse
if
they
perseuer
to
maintaine
any
more
such
peasants

Delight
not
as
I
haue
done
in
irreligious
oaths
for
from
the
blasphemers
house
a
curse
shall
not
depart

Despise
drunkennes
which
wasteth
the
wit
and
maketh
men
all
equall
vnto
beasts

Flie
lust
as
the
deathsman
of
the
soule
and
defile
not
the
temple
of
the
Holy
Ghost

Abhorre
those
epicures
whose
loose
life
hath
made
religion
loathsome
to
your
eares
and
when
they
sooth
you
with
tearms
of
mastership
remember
Robert
Greene
whome
they
haue
often
so
flattered
perishes
now
for
want
of
comfort

Remember
gentlemen
your
liues
are
like
so
many
light
tapers
that
are
with
care
deliuered
to
all
of
you
to
maintaine
these
with
wind-puft
wrath
may
be
extinguished
with
drunkennesse
put
out
with§
negligence
let
fall
for
mans
time
of
tselfe
is
not
so
short
but
it
is
more
shortened
by
sinne

The
fire
of
my
life
is
now
at
the
last
snuffe
and
the
want
of
wherewith
to
sustaine
it
there
is
no
substance
for
life
to
feed
on

Trust
not
then
I
beseech
yee
left
to
such
weake
stayes
for
they
are
as
changeable
in
minde
as
in
many
attires

Well
my
hand
is
tyred
and
I
am
forst
to
leaue
where
I
would
beginne
for
a
whole
booke
cannot
contain
their
wrongs
which
I
am
forst
to
knit
up
in
some
few
lines
of
wordes

The
remembrance
of
many
wrongs
offered
thee
and
thy
vnreprooued
vertues
adde
greater
sorrow
to
my
miserable
state
then
I
can
vtter
or
thou
conceiue

Neyther
is
it
lessened
by
consideration
of
thy
absence
(
though
shame
would
let
mee
hardly
behold
thy
face
but
exceedingly
aggrauated
for
that
I
cannot
(
as
I
ought
to
thy
owne
selfe
reconcile
myselfe
that
thou
mightest
witnesse
my
inward
woe
at
this
instant
that
haue
made
thee
a
wofull
wife
fo
so
long
a
time

But
equal
haeuen
hath
denied
that
comfort
giuing
at
my
last
neede
like
succour
as
I
haue
sought
all
my
life
being
in
this
extremitie
as
voyde
of
helpe
as
thou
has
beene
of
hope

Reason
would
that
after
so
long
waste
I
should
not
send
thee
a
childe
to
bring
thee
greater
charge
but
consider
hee
is
the
fruite
of
thy
wombe
in
whose
face
regard
not
the
fathers
so
much
as
thy
owne
perfections

Hee
is
yet
Greene
and
may
grow
strait
if
he
be
carefully
tended
otherwise
apt
enough
(
I
feare
me
to
follow
his
fathers
folly

That
I
haue
offended
thee
highly
I
know
that
thou
canst
forgette
my
iniuries
I
hardly
beleeue
yet
perswade
I
my
selfe
if
thou
saw
my
wretched
estate
thou
couldest
not
but
lament
it
nay
certainely
I
know
thou
wouldest

All
my
wrongs
muster
themselues
about
me
euery
euill
at
once
plagues
me

For
my
contempt
of
God
I
am
contemned
of
men
for
my
swearing
and
forswearing
no
man
will
beleeue
me
for
my
gluttony
I
suffer
hunger
for
my
drunkennes
thirst
for
my
adulterie
vlcerous
sores

GOD

Lord
when
you
woold
as
it
pleased
your

to
comfort
my

by

so

most
kynde

if

worth

me
say
a
little

The
Commissioners
by
imprisoning
the
witnesses
and
excommunicating
all
us
have
implicitly
justified
our
marriage

Sir
George
will
as
I
hear
keep
her
till
I
send
for
her
and
let
her
remain
there
yet
his
good
nature
and
her
sorrow
will
work
something

I
have
liberty
to
ride
abroad
and
feel
not
much
of
an
imprisonment

For
my

therefore

Of

the
way
which
my
letters
might
haunt

have
I
given
this
licence
to
travel
but
I
know
not
whither
nor
it

It
is
therefore
rather
a
pinnace
to
discover
and
the
entire
colony
of
letters
of
hundreds
an
fifties
must
follow
whose
employment
is
more
honourable
than
that
which
our
State
meditates
to
Virginia
because
you
are
worthier
than
all
of
that
country
of
which
that
is
a
wretched
inch
for
you
have
better
treasure
and
a
harmlessness

If
this
sound
like
a
flattery
tear
it
out

I
am
to
my
letters
as
rigid
as
a
Puritan
as
Caesar
was
to
his
wife

I
can
as
ill
endure
a

misinterpretable

MADAM
As
we
must
die
before
we
can
have
full
glory
and
happiness
so
before
I
can
have
this
degree
of
it
as
to
see
you
by
a
letter
I
must
also
die
that
is
come
to
London
to
plaguy
London
a
place
full
of
danger
and
vanity
and
vice
though
the
Court
be
gone
and
such
it
will
be
till
your
return
redeem
it

Not
that
the
greatest
virtue
in
the
world
which
is
you
can
be
such
a
marshal
as
to
defeat
or
disperse
all
the
vice
of
this
place
but
as
higher
bodies
remove
or
contract
themselves
when
better
come
so
at
your
return
we
shall
have
one
door
open
to
innocence

Yet
madam
you
are
not
such
an
Ireland
as
produceth
neither
ill
nor
good
no
spiders
nor
nightingales
which
is
a
rare
degree
of
perfection

But
you
have
found

that

out
of
her
detesting
of

if
we
will
make
that
our

bad

fill
us
with
good

To
abstain
from

was
therefore
but
the
childhood

Madam
Your
favours
to
me
are
everywhere
I
use
them
and
have
them

I
enjoy
them
at
London
and
leave
them
there
and
yet
find
them
at
Mitcham

Such
riddles
as
these
become
things
inexpressible
and
such
is
your
goodness

I
was
almost
sorry
to
find
your
servant
here
this
day
because
I
was
loth
to
have
any
witness
of
my
not
coming
home
last
night
and
indeed
of
my
coming
this
morning

But
my
not
coming
was
excusable
because
earnest
business
detained
me
and
my
coming
this
day
is
by
the
example
of
your
St.
Mary
Magdalen
who
rose
early
upon
Sunday
to
seek
that
which
she
loved
most
and
so
did
I

and
from
her
and
myself
I
return
such
thanks
as
are
due
to
one
to
whom
we
owe
all
the
good
opinion
that
they
whom
we
need
most
have
of
us

By
this
messenger
and
on
this
good
day
I
commit
the
enclosed
holy
hymns
and
sonnets
(
which
for
the
matter
not
the
workmanship
have
yet
escaped
the
fire
to
your
judgment
and
to
your
protection
too
if
you
think
them
worthy
of
it
and
I
have
appointed
this
enclosed
sonnet
to
usher
them
to
your
happy
hand

"
This
Tuesday
Morning
which
hath
brought
me
to
London
presents
me
with
all
your
letters

Methought
it
was
a
rent
day
I
mean
such
as
yours
and
not
as
mine
and
yet
such
too
when
I
considered
how
much
I
owed
you
for
them
how
good
a
mother
how
fertile
and
abundant
the
understanding
is
if
she
have
a
good
father
and
how
well
friendship
performs
that
office

For
that
which
is
denied
in
other
generations
is
done
in
this
of
yours
for
here
is
superfetation
child
upon
child
and
that
which
is
more
strange
twins
at
a
latter
conception

"
If
in
my
second
religion
friendship
I
had
a
conscience
either
errantem
to
mistake
good
and
bad
and
indifferent
or
opinantem
to
be
ravished
by
other's
opinions
or
examples
or
dubiam
to
adhere
to
neither
part
or
crupulosam
to
incline
to
one
but
upon
reasons
light
in
themselves
or
undiscussed
in
me
(
which
are
almost
all
the
diseases
of
conscience
I
might
mistake
your
often
long
and
busy
letters
and
fear
you
did
but
entreat
me
to
have
mercy
upon
you
and
spare
you
for
you
know
our
Court
took
the
resolution
that
it
was
the
best
way
to
despatch
the
French
Prince
back
again
quickly
to
receive
him
solemnly
ceremoniously
and
expensively
when
he
hoped
a
domestic
and
durable
entertainment

"
I
never
meant
to
excel
you
in
weight
nor
price
but
in
number
and
bulk
I
thought
I
might
because
he
may
cast
up
a
greater
sum
who
hath
but
forty
small
monies
than
he
with
twenty
Portugueses

The
memory
of
friends
(
I
mean
only
for
letters
neither
enters
ordinarily
into
busied
men
because
they
are
ever
employed
within
nor
into
men
of
pleasure
because
they
are
never
at
home

For
these
wishes
therefore
which
you
won
out
of
your
pleasure
and
recreation
you
were
as
excusable
to
me
if
you
write
seldom
as
Sir
H
Wotton
is
under
the
oppression
of
business
or
the
necessity
of
seeming
so
or
more
than
he
because
I
hope
you
have
both
pleasure
and
business
only
to
me
who
have
neither
this
omission
were
sin
for
though
writing
be
not
of
the
precepts
of
friendship
but
of
the
counsels
yet
as
in
some
cases
to
some
men
counsels
become
precepts
and
though
not
immediately
from
God
yet
very
roundly
and
quickly
from
His
Church
(
as
selling
and
dividing
goods
in
the
first
time
continence
in
the
Roman
Church
and
order
in
decency
in
ours
so
to
me
who
can
do
nothing
else
it
seems
to
bind
my
conscience
to
write
and
it
is
sin
to
do
against
the
conscience
though
that
err

"
Yet
no
man's
letters
might
be
better
wanted
than
mine
since
my
whole
letter
is
nothing
else
but
a
confession
that
I
should
and
would
write

To

I
pray
read
these
two

such
light

been
my

I
accompany
them
with
another
rag

verses
worthy
of
that
name
for
the
smallness
and
age
for
it
hath
long
lain
among
my
other
papers

laughs
at
them
that
have
adventured
to
you
for
I
think
till
now
you
saw
it
not

neither
you

repent
it

DEAR
MADAM
IT
troubled
me
much
that
you
should
thinke
me
so
negligent
as
not
to
have
written
to
you
againe
upon
so
many
sommons
as
itt
semes
the
messenger
of
your
last
sayth
he
gave
me
but
in
my
excuse
I
must
first
say
the
letter
was
left
hear
in
my
absence
and
sertainly
so
hath
his
caulings
binne
for
an
answer
if
at
all
for
I
have
examined
all
my
servants
to
whom
I
thought
itt
likely
he
might
have
addressed
himselfe
and
neyther
I
nor
they
can
remember
any
such
matter

Yett
perhaps
the
fault
hath
not
binne
his
neyther
soe
he
may
well
have
binne
often
hear
and
missed
me
for
som
litle
building
I
have
in
band
att
the
More
or
other
busnesses
thear
against
our
goeing
theather
this
sommer
hath
for
thes
many
weekes
carried
me
often
from
hom

Shewr
I
am
neyther
want
of
affection
or
desier
to
make
all
demonstrations
therof
hath
kept
my
letters
from
you
which
I
desier
you
will
believe
and
that
the
long
deferring
of
my
promis
to
vissitt
you
hath
binne
inforsed
by
those
occasions
I
could
not
avoid
but
this
sommer
I
hope
to
find
a
tyme
more
freely
mine
to
dispose
of
though
I
cannot
yett
name
any
being
to
attend
a
bargain
I
am
making
with
my
Lo.
of
Bucklngham's
officers
for
the
fee
farme
of
Combe
which
will
carry
me
sooner
or
later
theather
as
we
conclude
or
breake
but
I
will
first
injoine
you
to
give
me
your
word
that
you
shall
not
make
my
coming
eyther
a
troble
or
a
charge
for
you

My
Lo.
Mownteagle
and
my
Lo.
Chandos
are
very
shortly
goeing

growne

love
with
a
plentifull
fortune
and
a
privat
injoyeing
therof
as
he
shuns
all
other
conversation

When
they
are
gonne
ther
will
scarce
be
a
gentleman
to
be
seen
about
this
towne
whence
I
shall
not
stirre
till
after
Midsommer
terme

Out
of
Scotland
I
hear
no
newse
but
that
the
Inglish
of
quality
are
very
kindly
and
royally
entertained
by
the
nobility
but
the
meaner
sort
not
so
well
used
by
the
common
people
which
trobles
the
K.
extreamly
who
entertains
all
the
noblemen
went
with
him
not
as
servants
but
guests

This
is
all
his
jorney
hath
yett
brought
forth

By
the
next
you
can
send
to
London

unseasonable
tyme
and
I
beseech
you
be
more
confident
in
my
love
to
you
then
to
suspect
the
declination
therof
upon
the
omission
of
any
seremony
which
I
confesse
I
am
often
guilty
of
towards
my
freinds
though
never
willingly
of
any
such
neglect
as
may
give
them
a
just
cause
to
suspect
me
which
you
shall
never
have
but
all
the
proofes
in
my
power
that
I
am
as
much

wishe

DEARE
MADAM
—
I

nothing
to
acuse
you
of
though
you
cannot
but
condemne
me
as
a
promis
breaker
and
so
unmannerly
a
one
as
not
so
much
as
to
have
excused
myselfe
to
you
but
I
must
treuly
protest
that
every
weeke
since
my

Warwickshier
I
have
binne
setting
a
day

not
gett
the
liberty
of
2
or
3
days
to
goe
into
Rutland
nor
since
my
coming

leave
itt
so
many
days
as
wold
have
brought
me
to
you
and
backe
againe
which
I
protest
I
have
as
much
desired
as
I
now
do
any
thing
and
resolve
if
you
com
up

I
am
putte
in
som
hopes
you
will
to
lett
you
see
neither
winter
weather
nor
ways
can
fright
me
from
performing
before
Chrismas
what
I
could
not
in
the
summer
though
I
should
be
extream
glad
to
hear
we
should
meete
in
this
good
towne
because
then
I
should
hope
to
be

have
your

Mr

as
if
I

so
fond
of
any
man

wear
in
hard
case

The
last
busness
of

to
beg
of
you
the

how
you

I

Som
of
those
I
have
I
found
in
obscure
places
and
gentleman's
houses
that
because
they
wear
old
made
no
reckoning
of
them
and
that
makes
me
thinke
itt
likely
that
ther
may
yett
be
in
divers
places
many
excellent
unknown
peeses
for
which
I
lay
wayghte
with

my

when
Mr

he
shall

have
prety
store

DEAR
MADAM

Thus
you
see
itt
is
not
good
being
too
free
an
offerer
to
a
free
taker
but
be
not
discouraged
for
I
shall
be
as
free
a
requiter
whensoever
you
shall
make
me
know
itt
is
in
my
power

I
can not
send
you
much
newse
from
hence
the
best
is
that
after
many
difficultis
I
have
made
an
end
according
to
my
wishes
of
my
busness
with
the
K.
&
reseaved
his
graunt
with
many
excuses
for
the
delays
it
hath
had
and
so
much
complimente
as
hath
made
amends
the
worst
that
the
Queen
hath
bled
extreamly
of
late
whh
hath
so
weakened
her
as
I
much
fear
how
she
will
recover
itt
for
I
never
saw
her
look
so
dangerously
ill
wch
makes
me
oftener
a
courtier
than
I
intended
and
with
my
other
ocasions
will
I
think
draw
me
to
winter
att
London
whear
I
should
be
glad
to
hear
you
minded
to
go

Howsoever
I
thinke
I
shall
invite
you
towards
the
spring
to
do
my
niese
an
honor
if
I
can
compose
things
according
to
my
wishes
an
offer
being
made
me
for
her
pleases
me
well
&
I
doubt
not
will
take
effect
if
her
unreasonable
father
can
be
brought
to
do
what
he
ought
which
if
love
will
not
make
him
I
hope
fear
will
prevaile
but
of
this
lett
no
speache
passe
you
because
itt
is
yett
too
early
days
but
as
soone
as
itt
is
settled
to
any
certainty
&
that
the
K.
hath
declared
himselffe
whos
work
it
is
you
shall
hear
of
itt
more
perticularly
from
me
to
whom
itt
will
be
of
a
great
deal
of

So

RIGHT
HONOURABLE
Under
this
date
I
write
two
letters
unto
you
whereof
the
present
is
the
latter
and
is
written
to
correct
the
former

For
whereas
in
the
same
I
advertised
that
an
execution
had
been
done
upon
certain
mutinous
persons
of
the
Holland
troops
that
had
fortified
themselves
against
the
General
on
the
shore
of
Dalmatia
(
which
I
took
from
the
first
voice
there
is
now
(
though
I
am
sorry
to
express
it
fresher
advice
come
from
the
armata
that
those
mutineers
were
English
and
of
the
late
arrived
under
Sir
Henry
Peyton's
conduct
to
the
number
of
some
150
who
demanded
the
same
pay
that
the
foresaid
Hollanders
had
and
made
that
the
subject
of
their
division

To
which
the
General
made
answer
that
he
would
stand
to
the
contract
concluded
between
the
amabassador
of
this
State
and
their
conductor
in
England
and
therfore
wished
them
to
be
quiet
which
they
refusing
he
landed
200
Albanesi
to
reduce
them
by
force
against
whom
the
English
turned
their
pikes
and
their
shot
which
the
general
perceiving
he
laid
the
prows
of
two
of
his
galleys
against
them
and
so
they
yielded

Barbarigo
upon
this
forming
their
process
did
hang
eight
of
them
who
are
said
to
be
captains
lieutenants
and
corporals
and
that
three
of
these
did
die
in
the
Roman
faith

their
names
I
yet
know
not
which
shall
be
advertised
in
my
next

God
send
the
success
fairer
than
the
beginning

To
this
I
must
add
that
by
the
letters
of
Milan
arrived
at
this
moment
is
intimated
a
secret
conjunction
between
Fraunce
and
Savoy
against
the
Genovese
which
if
it
proceed
will
inflame
this
whole
country

These
be
resolutions
proper
for
the
canicular
days
which
are
newly
begun
with
us

Sir
I
take
presumption
upon
the
assured
promise
of
your
love
to
write
unto
you
herein
a
few
private
lines
about
myself
whereof
the
scope
is
this
to
beseech
you
that
as
you
have
obtained
leave
for
my
return
home
the
next
spring
to
the
comfortable
sight
of
my
gracious
master
so
you
will
be
pleased
likewise
to
deal
with
his
Majesty
in
my
behalf
that
none
may
be
appointed
to
succeed
me
here
till
my
arrival
because
when
I
have
settled
some
of
my
peculiar
occasions
I
shall
rather
wish
to
come
hither
back
again
than
to
be
onerous
to
his
Majesty
at
home
for
without
his
bounty
I
cannot
live

In
the
meanwhile
my
Italian
ssecretary
Gregorio
de'
Monti
(
who
supplied
the
place
all
the
while
that
Sir
Dudley
Carleton
was
at
Turino
and
afterwards
till
my
coming
will
discharge
it
with
fidelity
and
discretion
being
a
person
of
much
sufficiency
and
of
twelve
years'
approvement
in
the
King's
service

This
is
my
most
humble
and
hearty
request
unto
you
about
which
I
have
by
letter
prayed
Mr.
Bargrave
to
intercede
with
you
for
me

But
having
not
heard
from
him
I
thought
fit
provisionally
to
move
it
by
mine
own
pen
having
with
no
man
else
living
communicated
these
thoughts
about
which
I
shall
languish
to
receive
a
line
or
two
from
you

And
so
again
Sir
I
am
yours
HENRY
WOTTON

DEARE
CORNWALLIS
IT
is
one
of
my
misfortunes
and
such
a
one
as
I
assure
you
I
am
very
sensible
of
to
be
thus
farre
from
you
in
a
tyme
whearein
I
perseave
your
love
wold
have
made
me
that
to
you
which
I
as
affectionatly
desier
to
be
as
to
have
myselfe
the
comfort
of
a
freind
by
me
when
any
opresion
lies
heavy
on
my
hart
to
whom
I
might
trust
my
cares
and
be
shuer
they
should
not
only
be
safely
lodged
but
begett
a
desier
to
ease
them
as
farre
as
wear
possible
or
at
leaste
advise
how
to
make
them
lightest

I
remember
well
what
itt
was
you
feared
at
your
last
being
in
towne
and
I
am
sorrier
then
I
can
tell
you
that
ther
is
such
a
resemblance
in
our
destines
as
makes
you
like
me
a
trew
professer
to
yourselfe
of
ills
to
comme
whearin
I
have
seldom
failed

But
for
all
that
you
must
not
loose
couradge
nor
let
your
kind
sensiblenes
which
is
the
self-wordingest
thing
make
you
so
unkind
to
yourselfe
and
yours
as
to
yeald
up
the
strength
of
your
resisting
reason
and
consent
to
sincke
under
that
melancoly
such
heartofore
unexpected
distaste
must
needes
breed
in
you
which
I
grieve
hartely
to
heare
hath
already
rought
so
ill
effects
upon
your
health
and
so
strong
aprehencions
in
your
minde
though
I
trust
our
good
God
will
with
a
safe
deliverance
of
a
happy
bearth
restore
you
the
one
and
if
you
be
not
wanting
to
yourselfe
so
assist
you
as
you
shall
to
your
contentment
overcomme
what
causes
the
other
and
which
when
you
have
recovered
strengthe
of
body
againe
if
you
finde
to
continue
in
my
opinion
you
should
do
well
to
remoove
heather
whear
you
will
have
better
meanes
to
prevail
and
shall
have
my
servis
if
you
finde
may
be
fitt
for
you
to
imploye
me
or
shall
finde
itt
that
of
others
of
more
power
then
my
owne
by
declaring
that
I
have
ingaged
them
to
take
care
of
you
may
becomme
of
use
to
you
in
this
ocacion
who
I
dare
undertake
shall
do
itt
very
willingly
and
readily
and
perhaps
itt
wold
not
be
to
ill
purpos
if
ther
be
cause

Therfore
if
you
love
me
be
not
scrupulous
to
make
use
of
them

Itt
is
now
high
tyme
that
I
acknowledge
the
reseit
of
both
your
letters
by
this
bearer
and
withall
how
I
aprehend
your
kindnes
so
many
ways
expressed
to
me
in
them
but
no
words
can
do
itt
and
so
I
beseech
you
to
believe
because
itt
is
trew
and
besides
that
I
am
farre
from
undervaluing
for
misinterpret
I
cannot
the
liberality
you
therein
have
used
towards
me
which
is
much
more
then
ever
I
was
a
debtor
for
to
any
that
aught
itt
not
unto
me
or
then
I
have
a
hart
or
will
to
accept
if
I
durst
at
this
tyme
say
I
wold
refuse
what
you
so
presse
which
your
kindnes
only
and
the
knowledge
of
your
disposicion
takes
off
the
shame
I
have
so
long
detained
yett
I
will
now
keepe
itt
in
my
hands
as
you
will
have
me
though
I
must
still
as
your
tresurer
not
as
a
legacy
and
that
you
will
live
to
give
me
tyme
when
I
shall
leave
the
world
and
be
wittnes
I
am
not
behind
hand
with
you
in
affection
and
desier
to
live
in
your
memory
be
confident
that
ther
is
nonne
of
yours
to
whom
I
will
be
more
wanting
in
any thing
I
may
do
for
them
then
I
wold
have
binn
to
my
owne
if
God
had
continued
me
a
mother
and
whear
as
your
request
is
in
general
and
extends
to
nothing
but
what
I
hope
you
believe
not
so
ill
of
me
as
to
thinke
I
wold
not
without
itt
have
donne
and
more
I
beseech
you
if
you
can
thinke
itt
to
any
purpos
impose
something
more
perticularly
on
me
for
I
will
perform
itt
as
I
desier
God
should
have
mercie
on
me
joyfullie
I
confesse
in
your

if
I
outlive
you
which
wheather

my
leve

xvi
of
September
1619

Venice
this
3rd
of
February
1619

Right
Honourable
and
my
very
good
Lord
I
am
very
glad
of
this
opportunity
that
by
the
hand
of
a
gentleman
who
doth
so
entirely
honour
you
both
in
his
continual
speech
and
in
his
soul
I
may
revive
also
with
your
Lordship
mine
own
long
devotion
even
since
the
time
that
I
did
first
contemplate
your
noble
virtues
when
I
was
a
poor
student
at
Altorph
which
were
my
happiest
days

For
what
have
I
since
observed
in
my
employments
but
a
few
maxims
of
State
too
high
for
my
capacity
and
too
subtle
for
my
nature
which
was
cast
in
a
plainer
mould

Is
then
at
least
my
fortune
mended

Alas
my
dear
Lord
let
me
not
think
of
that

For
when
I
consider
how
all
those
of
my
rank
have
been
dignified
and
benefited
at
home
while
I
have
been
gathering
of
cockles
upon
this
lake
I
am
in
good
faith
impatient
more
of
the
shame
than
of
the
sense
of
want

Yet
this
is
my
comfort
that
my
gracious
Master
(
as
it
hath
pleased
him
to
let
me
know
doth
love
me

For
the
public
affairs
we
stand
here
yet
very
ambiguously

The
land
was
long
since
quiet
but
the
sea
as
the
more
movable
element
is
still
in
agitation
and
we
are
artificially
kept
at
excessive
charge
by
a
mad
Viceroy
and
a
winking
Pope
while
the
King
of
Spayne
in
the
meanwhile
standeth
at
the
benefit
of
time
and
fortune
ready
to
authorize
or
disavow
the
event
according
to
the
success
which
I
take
to
be
the
sum
of
our
case

but
these
things
will
be
more
particularly
delivered
to
your
lordship
by
this
'redeemed
Neptune'
as
I
have
baptized
him
for
they
here
think
him
more
than
a
man
that
knows
so
much
more
than
themselves

And
in
truth
if
any
place
had
been
vacant
worthy
of
his
sufficiency
there
wanted
no
desire
to
hold
him
as
they
have
expressed
by
offers
to
himself
and
declared
in
their
letters
by
him
to
their
ambassador
and
most
of
all
in
the
confident
communication
of
their
affairs
and
desires
with
him
which
likewise
include
some
hope
of
their
having
him
again
as
your
Lordship
will
perceive
by
the
subject
of
my
dispatch
to
the
King
which
he
carrieth

I
must
add
hereunto
for
mine
own
part
that
I
have
been
glad
of
this
occasion
which
hath
given
me
a
better
taste
of
him
and
of
his
fair
and
clear
dispositions
than
I
could
take
at
a
transitory
view
when
I
passed
my
last
duty
with
your
Lordship
in
Canterburie
and
I
am
likewise
almost
not
sorry
that
I
have
yet
not
seen
a
letter
which
he
tells
me
your
Lordship
wrote
by
him
unto
me

For
it
would
have
made
me
the
more
ashamed
to
have
done
him
so
little
service
here
that
had
brought
me
such
a
favour
though
I
am
otherwise
not
poor
of
your
Lordship's
gracious
lines
whereof
I
preserve
to
this
hour
a
great
roll
and
especially
one
which
I
long
for
some
hour
to
show
your
Lordship
because
I
know
in
your
nobleness
you
cannot
deny
it
though
in
my
meanness
I
could
never
deserve
it

And
here
I
will
end
your
lordship's
trouble
with
my
prayers
to
our
loving
God
for
your
happiness

Ever
remaining
Your
Lordship's
with
an
honest
heart
to
serve
you
HENRY
WOTTON

Whereof
he
hath
likewise
a
testimony
from
his
Majesty
under
his
royal
hand
sent
him
in
the
time
of
Sir
Ralphe
Winwoode
for
his
better
encouragement
after
my
predecessor
and
myself
had
represented
his
good
deservings

Now
to
return
to
myself

I
carry
in
my
breast
besides
that
honest
business
which
you
know
some
important
commissions
from
this
State
which
have
a
silent
reflection
(
though
not
meant
by
them
upon
our
main
end

These
I
shall
particularize
in
my
letter
from
Augusta
and
will
end
the

with
mine
humble
thanks
to
Almighty
God
for
the
happy
news
which
we
have
had
this
week
of
his
Majesty's
escape
from
a
painful
infirmity

The
same
good
God
yield
him
long
unto
us
and
to
the
Christian
world

And
so

DEAR
MADAM
As
full
of
just
sorrow
as
my
hart
can
bear
I
retorne
you
affectionat
thankes
for
your
kind
sending

What
a
mother
I
have
lost
I
need
not
tell
you
that
know
what
she
was
in
herselfe
and
to
me

But
alas

this
is
but
a
fearfull
comfort
to
him
and
his
freinds
considering
her
estate
which
gives
him
too
much
cause
of
doubt
wheather
she
will
ever
bring
any
well
into
the
world
or
no
for
sertainly
this
tooke
much
harme
by
her
unrulynes
both
in
the
breeding
and
bearth

Yett
God
is
all
sufficient
and
I
trust
will
blesse
so
good
a
father
with
the
joye
of
leaveing
som
of
his
owne
to
succeed
him
and
the
rather
am
I
incouraged
to
be
confident
He
will
show
favor
to
him
and
to
the
prayers
of
his
freinds
therin
because
though
he
was
very
fond
of
this
yett
in
those
tymes
of
fear
the
child's
being
subject
to
som
infirmities
gave
us
he
ever
kept
a
mind
ready
prepared
to
resigne
att
God's
pleasure
so
unexpected
a
blessing

Now
itt
is
com
to
the
trial
I
am
confident
he
will
show
well
tempered
effects
of
that
religious
resolution
and
bear
with
pacience
what
the
Almighty
hath
donne
though
itt
be
more
to
him
then
the
losse
of
an
only
sonne
to
another
father

My
losse
of
a
dear
mother
camme
not
so
unexpectedly
as
my
Lord
Chamberlain's
did
att
this
tyme
for
to
outward
apearance
his
child
mended
but
my
mother
so
manifestly
decayed
daylie
as
I
could
not
flatter
myselfe
with
hope
she
could
continue
long
though
I
looked
not
her
ende
wold
have
binne
so
sodaine
yett
the
disease
she
was
subject
to
threatened
no
lesse
which
I
sorting
with
that
opinion
she
ever
had
since
I
knew
her
that
her
ende
wold
be
sodaine
made
itt
I
thanke
God
not
so
to
her
who
hath
left
many
seremonis
how
well
she
was
prepared
for
itt
which
is
my
unspeakeable
comfort

Itt
now
rests
for
me
to
follow
as
well
as
I
can
her
good
example
which
God
graunt
I
may
in
liveing
for
his
servis
that
I
may
die
in
his
favor
whom
I
beseech
to
blesse
you
and
yours
and
you
to
comende
me
affectionatly

Mr

DEAR
MADAM
I
WAS
long
in
much
hope
that
you
wold
have
held
your
purpos
of
coming
to
London
this
spring
wheare
I
have
binne
constrained
to
be
almost
all
this
tyme
since
your
going
hence
which
has
made
me
the
greater
looser
by
the
change
of
your
purpos
as
I
am
much
the
sorrier
for
that
losse
since
your
want
of
health
hath
binne
the
occasion
to
keep
you
both
from
hence
and
the
More
the
places
in
this
kingdom
you
may
justlie
chalendge
to
be
wellcom
to
while
they
are
mine

whear
you
should
find
yourself
payd
with
most
affection
as
in
all
others
whearsoever
I
am
to
injoye
your
companie
which
if
I
did
not
believe
you
wear
confident
of
itt
wold
be
an
extreame
increase
of
misfortune
to
me
since
you
could
not
imagine
any
good
to
be
in
one
that
should
requite
with
less
so
many
real
proofes
of
affection
as
I
have
reseaved
from

loveing
you
very
hartely
and
that
I
am
sure
I
doe
and
doubt
not
of
your

so
assured
after
which
no
more
is
needfull
to
be
sayd
since
that
includes
all
in
my
power

You
have
sent
me
the
finest
litle
beaste
that
ever
I
saw
whos
beauty
may
excuse
many
faults
if
she

any

How
well

will
play

be

howsoever
she
proove
she
shall
be
much
made
of
for
the
hands'
sake
she
comes
from

Thus

you

greatest
nuse

my

coitted

a

another

doe
from

I
should
not
have
binne
so
many
months
without

but
that
for
this
two
last
I
have
had
so
much
ill
health
and
paine
as
made

CORNEWALLIS
—
I
am
sorry
Mr
Bacon
and
you
are
so
punctual
observers
of
the
comandement
empties
this
towne
which
itt
is
now
too
late
in
regard
of
the
state
you
are
in
to
tell
you
that
if
I
had
thought
that
had
binne
any
stay
to
your
being
a
Londoner
this
winter
l
wolde
have
donne
you
the
servis
to
have
gotten
you
a
dispensation
whos
companie
I
should
have
binne
extream
glad
to
have
had
hear
whear
I
shall
be
for
the
most
part
till
the
spring
and
though
in
this
I
am
a
greate
looser
yett
itt
trobles
me
more
to
hear
how
aprehensive
you
are
of
a
danger
itt
hath
pleased
God
to
carry
you
so
often
safely
through
and
so
I
doubt
not
will
againe
though
you
may
do
yourselfe
and
yours
much
harme
by
those
doubtings
and
ill
companions
for
all
persons
and
worst
for
us
splenetick
creatures

I
will
write
you
no
newse
for
that
I
leave
to
Mr
Bacon
who
may
hear
in
the
towne
very
near
as
much
as
I
know
since
what
is
like
a
secret
passeth
underneath
and
so
sounds
not
so
farre
as
this
end
of
the
towne
only
I
will
give
you
my
testimony
that
the
Prince
is
the
most
improved
man
that
ever
I
saw
and
that
my
Lo.
of
Buckingham
recovers
much
of
what
he
had
lost
so
as
you
may
see
that
the
only
Wyse
who
brings
light
out
of
darknes
can
favour
us
by
ways
we
could
not
imagine
could
have
produced
such
happy
effects

The
litle
juel
you
sent
me
is
a
tresure
being
the
finest
and
best
that
I
thinke
was
ever
of
her
kind
for
which
since
I
cannot
thanke
you
enuffe
I
will
use
no
words
to
thanke
you
for
at
all

noble

DEARE
MADAM
I
HAVE
binne
hindered
frorn
sending
to
you
as
I
purposed
first
for
want
of
a
footeman
and
sinse
by
the
sadde
accident
of
my
Lo.
of
Richmond's
death
which
tied
me
to
give
my
tyme
to
the
performance
of
the
charitable
offices
I
could
to
his
La.

Now
I
send
with
a
great
deale
of
earnest
longing
for
the
retorne
of
this
bearer
because
by
your
brother
I
hear
you
have
binne
ill
since
your
being
delivered
but
I
truste
itt
is
no
other
then
som
indisposition
incident
to
childe bed
and
that
I
shall
hear
you
have
recovered
better
health
which
I
wish
as
hartely
att
the
leaste
as
the
continuance
of
my
owne

Howsoever
since
the
very
season
of
the
yeare
invites
you
to
itt
lett
mee
perswade
you
as
soone
as
you
are
able
to
comme
to
London
wheare
the
best
meanes
are
for
the
recovery
or
confirmacion
of
your
health

You
know
your
olde
lodgeings
which
or
as
convenient
a
one
if
I
keepe
you
out
of
that
shall
be
ready
for
you
and
I
infinitely
gladde
of
your
companie
and
Mr
Ba-con's

I
never
so
much
longed
to
speake
with
you
and
to
have
you
out
of
that
solitarie
place
wheare
I
heare
melancholie
getts
two
much
ground
of
you
which
is
so
dangerous
an
enemie
as
I
extreamlie
desier
to
have
you
so
neare
me
as
I
might
offer
you
my
best
assistance
and
servis
to
overcom
itt
in
yourself
and
remove
the
causes
if
itt
be
possible

First
my
La.
of
Richmond's
losse
though
it
weare
such
a
blow
from
Heaven
as
I
must
confesse
I
never
knew
given
will
not
kille
her
of
so
strandge
resisting
stue
are
our
hartes
made

She
was
the
happiest
woman
I
thinke
that
lived
for
by
her
owne
confession
she
acknowledged
that
if
she
should
have
sitte
doune
and
studied
what
to
aske
of
God
for
outward
blessings
and
inwarde
comforts
of
this
world
more
then
she
enjoyed
she
could
find
nothing
to
desier
but
a
child
and
it
was
true
for
she
had
of
glorie
and
greatnes
as
much
as
a
subject
was
capable
of
wealth
of
all
kinds
in
abundance
health
and
extraordinary
beautie
even
at
this
adge
and
above
all
a
noble
husband
that
was
the
love
of
her
harte
and
doted
on
her
with
the
same
pasion
to
the
last
ower
of
his
lyfe
that
he
did
the
first
month
of
his
being
in
love
with
her

Out
of
those
loveing
armes
she
rose
not
two
owers
before
he
died
and
left
him
as
she
thought
well
only
troubled
with
a
litle
paine
in
his
head
which
made
him
desirous
to
sleep
a
litle
longer
which
and
his
death
was
so
quiet
as
his
man
sitting
close
to
his
bedside
knew
not
when
he
departed
but
fearing
because
itt
was
the
day
apointed
for
the
parliment
that
he
might
wake
too
late
called
in
a
gentleman
of
his
chamber
that
used
to
wake
him
who
drawing
the
curtain
found
him
starke
dead

I
lay
by
chaunce
that
night
att
the
Cockepitte
whither
instantly
this
nuse
was
brought
me
and
I
presently
went
to
the
Duches
in
whos
lodgeings
was
to
be
seen
all
that
an
unexpected
calamity
could
show
of
sorrow

I
much
feared
the
first
violence
might
have
distracted
her
but
her
pasion
had
so
liberal
vent
as
I
thinke
itt
wrought
the
less
inwardly

Her
haire
in
discharge
of
a
vowe
she
had
formerly
made
she
cutte
off
close
by
the
rootes
that
afternoone
and
told
us
of
som
other
vowes
of
retirednes
she
had
made
if
she
should
be
so
miserable
as
to
outlive
him
which
I
hope
she
will
as
punctually
performe

For
my
part
I
confesse
I
incouradge
her
to
itt
which
som
say
hereafter
she
will
love
me
nothing
the
better
for
but
itt
is
the
counsel
I
should
take
to
myselfe
in
her
case
and
therfore
I
cannot
spare
to
give
itt

She
offers
to
deall
very
nobly
with
my
Lo.
of
Lenox
yett
I
imagine
ther
will
grow
differences
betwixt
them
out
of
his
Lady's
over greedines
for
they
already
refuse
to
accept
condisions
they
had
subscribed
to
though
if
she
have
not
very
harsh
and
unusual
measure
offered
her
itt
is
in
her
choise
wheather
to
part
with
any
thing
to
them
or
no

The
Lord

had
the
good
fortune
to
passe
from
a
noble
to
a
worthie
hand
wheare
I
hope
itt
will
long
remaine

But
I
fear
I
do
ill
to
wearie
you
with
so
many
lines
therfore

I
could
not
love
enoffe
for

can
I
ever

such

I
ought

such

I
am
sure
nothing
on

recover
much
hold
on
me

leaft

freinds
I
love
better

this
hath
made
me
see
that
I
must
have
the
best
freinds
in
the
world
but
to
loose
them
I
know
not
how
soone
for
he
that
was
so
sodainly
taken
from
me
both
for
his
years
strength
health

temper
was
like
to
have
lived
to
much
greater
adge
than
any
I
have
left
and
so
I
think
would
had
not
his
noble
hart
binne
too
great
for
thes
tymes
and
his
fortunes
in
them

But
he
is
I
doubt
not
now
wheare
nothing
of
felicity
is
grudged
him
and
hath
left
behind
him
more

sorowfull

then
any
man's
death
now

many
of
us
yett
know
not
how
to
indure
one
another's
sight
being
deprived
of
his
for
myselfe
I
must
trewly
say
I
am

worse

so
is
my

Saterday

My
Lo.
of
Kensington
retornes
instantly
againe
into
France

To
my
noble
and
worthy
freind

DEAR
CORNWALLEIS
I
HAVE
written
as
effectually
as
I
could
to
my
Lo.
Chamberlain
who
I
thinke
if
it
be
in
his
power
will
do
what
you
desier

What
the
King's
resolucion
is
yett
for
his
owne
and
his
father's
servants
he
hath
not
declared
farder
then
the
whight
staves
which
are
to
remaine
as
they
wear
but
for
the
greene
cloth
and
other
inferior
officers
both
of
the
household
and
chamber
itt
is
thought
he
will
imploye
his
owne
and
dismisse
his
father's
because
he
hath
caused
the
latter
to
be
all
removed
to
Denmarke
House
to
attende
the
body
and
lodged
the
former
about
himselfe
att
Whitehalle
and
for
aught
any body
yett
can
discover
he
makes
his
owne
determinacions
and
is
very
stiff
in
them
having
already
changed
the
whole
face
of
the
court
very
near
to
the
same
forme
itt
had
in
Queene
Elizabeth's
tyme
suffering
nonne
but
the
counsell
and
his
bedchamber
to
come
further
than
the
privie
chamber
whear
he
continually
abides
nor
the
councell
to
go
furder
than
the
privie
gallerie
and
causes
itt
to
be
strictly
kept
likewise

Into
the
presence
no
more
are
admitted
than
his
owne
servants
and
gentlemen
of
quality

Of
his
bedchamber
he
hath
sworn
nonne
more
than
he
had
before
but
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
whom
he
uses
very
well
but
it
is
hoped
will
be
governed
by
no
man
nor
will
he
admitt
any
of
the
rest
as
is
thought

After
the
funerall
itt
is
expected
that
he
will
make
som
alteracions
among
the
great
officers
and
the
coon
voice
is
change
my
Lord
Chamberlain's
staffe
into
that
I
shall
never
but
with
sorrow
see
in
other
hand
than
that
that
held
itt
last
and
bestow
his
upon
his
brother

Yett
so
far
he
hath
not
yett
declared
himself
but
if
this
be
I
have
taken
order
that
if
any
power
remaine
in
the
Chamberlaine
for
the
gentlemen
ushers'
places
whethersoever
of
them
hold
that
staffe
itt
shall
be
alike
for
your
request
and
this
I
did
because
I
think
the
chamber
will
not
be
settled
till
the
principal
officer
be
so

This
I
know
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
from
one
you
believe
would
wright
no
untruth
to
you
and
that
hath
made
me
(
though
I
am
not
much
disposed
to
wright
newse
sett
down
this
much

To
which
I
will
adde
that
our
destined
Queene
is
with
all
possible
speede
expected
hear
for
whos
coming
the
coronacion
will
be
stayed
that
that
and
her
mariadge
and
entrie
may
be
all
but
one
charge
but
the
first
mariadge
in
France
will
be
instantly
tbe
King
having
sent
his
procsey
to
the
King
of
France
that
either
his
brother
or
the
Duke
of
Chevreux
(
which
is
Prince
Joinville
that
was
here
may
dispach
that
so
as
the
next
month
she
is
expected
all
else
being
fully
concluded
and
they
in
France
hastening
the
espousals

I
am
very
glad
to
hear
Mr
Bacon
hath
recovered
so
good
health
whos
welcom
shall
ever
be
such
whear
I
am
as
I
owe
to
his
meritt
and
you
whos
labor
I
do
not
pittie
so
much
but
that
I
wish
you
would
beare
him
companie
to
this
solitarie
place
whear
I
do
not
desier
to
see
many
now
living
but
yourselfe
very
much

I
writt
to
my
Lord
Chamberlaine
to
lett
John
Fenne
know
his
answer
because
he
came
not
back
hither
and
had
I
binne
sure
when
I
should
have
seene
him
I
would
rather
have
spoken
than
writt
though
I
know
in
effect
it
will
be
all
one
for
he
knows
by
my
lines
as
well
as
he
could
have
done
by
speach
that
I
as
earnestly
affect
the
successe
of
my
recomendacion
as
I
can
doe
any thing
in
his
power
to
doe
and
I
was
so
loth
Mr
Glover
should
have
any thing
to
impute
to
my
least
delay
as
I
writt
so
late
the
last
night
to
my
Lord
Chamberlain
and
dispached
John
Fenne
as
I
could
not
send
this
from
hence
with
him
who
went
earlier
than
I
was
awake
this
morning
but
make
haste
itt
may
overtake
him
att
London

The
lying
Papists
cannot
be
content
to
want
my
Lord
Stuartt
in
the
beadrole
of
those
they
wold
have
thought
for
their
glorie
but
whosoever
knew
him
living
I
hope
will
reseave
no
such
false
opinion
now
he
is
dead
who
eaven
after
he
was
speechless
gave
evident
demonstracion
(
being
asked
by
his
chaplain
that
he
believed
to
be
saved
by
the
meritts
of
Christ
yett
by
the
follie
or
villeinie
of
a
ficisian
wayted
on
him
(
who
was
Popish
have
they
got
some
colour
to
invent
this
slander
which
I
trust
will
be
cleared
to
all
the
world
as
it
is
clear
in
itselfe
to
those
friends
from
whom
he
had
not
a
reserved
thought
and
that
knew
how
far
both
in
sound
judgment
as
well
as
practise
he
was
from
approving
any
point
of
their
doctrine
disagreeing
with
the
creed
we
profess

I
pray
God
they
knew
him
not
so
well
to
be
the
boldest
opposer
of
their
ends
as
they
used
means
for
the
shortening
of
his
noble
dayes
which
that
they
wear
unnaturally
cutte
off
ther
are
strong
suspicions
in
the
most
because
being
att
first
by
the
testimonie
of
all
the
surgeons
phisicians
and
his
owne
servants
as
fayer
a
corse
as
ever
their
eyes
beheld
in
the
space
of
three
owres
his
hoole
body
head
and
every
part
swelled
so
strangely
and
gangrened
so
generally
as
it
astonished
them
all
though
the
phisicians
affirme
to
have
seene
the
like
in
pestilential
fevers
when
the
spots
break
not
out
afore
death
and
impute
part
of
the
cause
to
the
expedient
of
chafing
his
body
att
least
for
the
space
of
an
hour
before
he
departed
with
hotte
cloths
and
keeping
itt
to
close
in
the
bed
after

God
only
knows
the
truth
who
if
he
had
any
wrong
I
trust
will
in
his
justice
declare
it

It
is
true
that
when
he
was
opened
in
his
stomack
and
head
there
appeared
nothing
to
confirm
this
jealosie
which
makes
the
phisicians
confident
it
could
be
no
poison
they
are
in
these
parts
acquainted
with
yett
both
myselfe
and
many
other
of
his
friends
rest
not
clear
of
doubt
though
but
upon
some
farder
evidence
it
is
not
to
be
stirred
in
but
if
ever
the
least
light
can
be
gotten
the
feare
of
all
mortal
men
should
not
hinder
our
just
prosecucion
of
so
abominable
a
fact
which
yett
if
it
wear
so
hastened
our
losse
but
a
little
for
all
his
vital
parts
wear
so
decayed
as
by
the
judgment
of
the
doctors
he
could
hardly
have
lived
out
a
year
which
nobody
that
looked
on
him
could
have
suspected
yett
he
himselfe
told
me
this
last
winter
that
he
found
such
an
inward
decaye
in
himselfe
as
he
knew
he
should
live
but
awhile
but
God
knows
I
conceived
it
to
be
but
a
melancholy
aprehension
seeing
his
health
better
to
my
thinking
than
it
had
beene
a
year
or
two
before
for
his
spleene
seemed
to
trouble
him
lesse

My
thoughts
are
and
ever
will
be
full
of
his
memorie
which
makes
me
tedious
when
any thing
draws
me
into
discourse
of
him
yett
will
I
not
excuse
this
temper
because
it
is
a
duty
I
owe
him
in
this
detracting
tyme
when
those
that
durst
not
have
breathed
amis
on
his
leaste
action
while
he
lived
will
now
ventur
as
much
as
in
them
lies
to
slubber
his
fame
when
they
shall
thinke
themselves
out
of
the
hearing
of
those
would
make
them
keepe
in
their
venom
or
make
them
smart
for
uttering
it
at
the
least

And
now
I
have
donne
this
it
is
tyme
I
ende
whos
love
and
respect
to
you
shall
be
endless
in
which
to
my
sorrow
you
cannot
have
so
much
advantage
as
I
have
satisfaction
to
know
myselfe
for
your
most
affectionate
and
faithful
though
most
unfortunate

My
very
goode
Lord
The
wind
hanges
so
at
Northwest
that
I
doubt
neither
our
letters
nor
yours
can
find
passage
els
should
we
not
be
thus
longe
in
suspence
by
reason
of
a
rumor
that
hath
held
there
eight
or
nine
dayes
that
our
side
hath
receved
a
great
blow
wherin
Sir
Thomas
Winne
Sir
Walter
Devreux
captain
Tubbe
captain
Dakers
and
I
know
not
how
many
more
should
be
lost

Though
this
be
yet
but
a
verball
report
without
any
certaintie
by
writing
yet
yt
is
generally
beleved
for
yll
newes
commonly
proves
too
true

Our
parlament
that
was
to
begin
on
Tewsday
is
proroged
till
the
last
of
this
moneth
and
yt
is
doubted
whether
or
where
yt
will
hold
then
for
yf
the
sicknes
increase
as
yt
begins
yt
is
thought
both
that
and
the
next
terme
shalbe
removed
to
Oxford
or
Winchester

Our
whole
number
this
weeke
was
379
of
the
plague
71
parishes
infected
17

We
have
many
proclamations
daylie
one
among
the
rest
that
no
person
comming
from
places
infected
presume
to
come
neere
the
court
another
for
the
repressing
of
the
insolence
of
our
souldiers
now
in
their
way
to
Plimmouth
that
begin
to
follow
the
stepps
of
their
predecessors
that
went
with
Mansfeld
in
pillaging
and
spoyling
whatsoever
they
can
lay
hand
on

Our
navie
is
not
yet
so
forward
that
there
needs
such
haste

The
common
opinion
is
now
that
they
go
to
the
West
Indies
which
mee
thincks
were
too
long
and
hazardous
a
viage
for
such
a
fleet

Our
order
of
the
Garter
is
much
graced
by
the
election
of
the
Earles
of
Dorset
Holland
and
the
Lord
Andover

The
earle
of
Northampton
is
saide
to
be
gon
after
the
Duke
to
Paris
but
I
shold
rather
take
yt
to
be
the
Lord
Compton

Mary
I
cannot
conceve
the
reason
why
Sir
Paul
Banning
shold
post

this
day
sevenight
unles
there
be
a
purpose
to

Sackvile
Crow
arrived
here
on
Thursday
from
the
Duke
and
bringes
word
how
noblie
he
and
his
train
were
entertained
that
all
things
go
well
that
the
delay
of
the
Quenes
comming
was
only
hers
and
the
King
her
brothers
sicknes
and
that
she
is
alredy
on
the
way
hitherward

one
of
his
principall
errands
is
to
cary
the
Dukes
gay
clothes

I
heare
that
Secretarie
Morton
is
to
be
with
you
shortly
as
extraordinarie
ambassador
and
comes
directly
from
Paris
having
his
entertainment
of
fowre
pound
a
day
allowed
from
three
or
fowre
dayes
before
he
went

the
Duches
of
Buckingam
is
said
to
be
with
child
which
is
no
small
joye

So
with
the
remembrance
of
my
best
service
to
my
goode
lady
I
commend
you
to
the
protection
of
the
Almighty

The

goes
toward
Caunterburie
to
meet

To
the
right
honourable
Sir
Dudley
Carleton
Lord
Ambassador
for
his
Majestie
at
the
Hagh

My
very
goode
Lord
I
am
sory
to
see
our
yll
newes
so
fully
confirmed
by
yours
of
the
7=th=
of
this
present
but
more
sory
for
your
niece
Dakers
whose
case
is
every
way
to
be
pitied

I
cannot
so
much
lament
the
rest
whose
lives
were
well
bestowed
to
redeeme
us
out
of
so
dull
a
lethargie
and
to
make
the
world
see
our
wonted
courage
is
not
quite
lost
for
I
could
never
commend
those
warie
gamesters
that
rather
then
venture
to
set
up
a
small
rest
sometimes
wold
loose
all
their
monie
in
stakes

We
talke
of
a
rich
Holland
East
Indian
ship
that
lay
last
weeke
two
whole
dayes
in
the
Downes
in
sight
of
the
Kings
ships
that
wold
not
see
her
wherby
we
may
easilie
perceve
how
the
world
goes

Our
souldiers
passe
daylie
towards
Plimmouth
where
Sir
John
Ogle
and
others
are
to
traine
and
discipline
them

The
common
speach
runs
of
15000
land
souldiers
at
least
a
band
of
Bedfordshire
men
(
they
say
have
killed
their
lieutenant
or
conductor
and
are
run
away
and
dispersed

We
have
now
almost
every
day
posts
out
of
Fraunce
that
bring
word
the
Quene
is
on
her
way
by
this
time
as
far
as
Amiens
where
she
is
to
tarrie
three
dayes
and
makes
acoount
to
be
at
Bologne
by
Whitsunday
eve
and
here
the
Saturday
after

the
pencioners
and
some
of
the
traine
are
gon
before
but
the
formost
were
the
Marquise
Hamilton
the
countesses
of
Buckingam
Denbigh
and
Anglesey
with
the
French
Lady
Carie
who
went
away
on
Thursday
with
intent
to
go
to
Bologne
where
the
Lady
Carie
sayes
she
must
cast
her self
at
the
Quene
dowagers
feet
for
auncient
favors

Here
is
a
new
world
of
Scottish
men
come
thirty
Lords
at
least
in
the
court
atonce
but
yt
is
hoped
the
Kings
journy
will
disperse
them
there
is
no
remedy
(
they
say
but
the
King
must
go
into
Scotland
to
be
crowned
which
yet
he
may
do
at
leasure
I
hope

Our
weekely
bill
is
not
much
risen

about
fowre

five
and
twentie

I

when
I
am

as
shows
they
proseed
from
such
humors
as
phisicke
uses
to

against
which
I
have
too
rebellious
a
spleene
I
doubt
to
be
brought
into
such
obedience
as
not
faster
to
power
out
the
souernes
therof
into
my
stomache

distill
itt
into
other
parts
then
all
the
poticarie's
drugs
will
be
able
to
correct

What
I
do
therfore
is
rather
because
itt
shall
not
be
layd
to
my
charge
that
I
neglect
the
meanes
of

out

great
hope
of

no

I

They
have
had
som
way
given
them
which
is
understood
by
them
as
a
good
signe
of

relenting
who
may

he

have
of

what
none

MY
MOST
HONORED
LADY
AND
DEAREST
FREND
I
RETORNE
you
humble
thankes
for
your
coach
which
brought
us
well
to
Coulchester
where
I
met
Mr
Randolph
with
another
but
not
one
that
will
bring
us
to
London
before
Saturday
night
I
perseave
nothing
by
him
that
should
cause
my
stay
in
London
longer
then
to
see
my
mother
and
doe
my
duty
to
her
for
she
finds
good
frends
to
helpe
her
to
money
out
of
the
Exchequer
and
that
is
all
she
is
like
to
expect
he
tells
me
yet
I
am
resolved
to
trie
what
may
be
done
for
her
and
then
make
hast
to
kiss
your
hands
at
Brome
again
which
I
hope
to
doe
within
a
fortnight
or
three
weekes

My
father
to
my
great
joye
made
his
last
actions
sutable
to
his
former
which
was
he
did
his
indevor
to
sell
his
offis
which
was
made
over
to
Mr
Randolph
before
and
came
so
neer
it
as
the
man
was
in
the
howse
with
money
to
paie
for
it
when
at
the
instant
he
failed
of
words
and
breath
soe
nothing
was
done

If
Mr
Randolph
had
not
gone
as
he
did
it
seemes
he
had
lost
his
offis
for
my
Lord
Carlisle
coended
one
to
the
King
which
he
apointed
to
posses
my
father's
plase
Mr
Randolph
being
such
a
stranger
as
I
think
they
knew
not
what
right
he
had
to
it
but
now
they
are
perswaded
to
let
the
man
paie
for
it
and
be
his
partner
and
reseave
half
the
benefit
which
he
might
have
possesed
alone
had
he
not
neglected
it
as
he
doth
all
things
but
he
seemes
glad
ther
is
one
to
do
the
busines
for
him
that
he
may
live
like
a
drone
as
he
did

I
am
your
most
true
harted
cosin
and
humblest
servant

all
things
are
yet

nothing
to
be
done
about
her
money
till
the
King
come
and
till
she
know
what
to
trust
to
so
she
will
by
noe
means
let
me
leave
her

I
have
no
hope
of
seeing
your

is

if

doe
you
will
be
still
the
stronger

or
any thing

for

one

I

with
a
very
good
cooke
that
served
in
a
Lord's
house
ayght
yeares

MY
MOST
HONORED
LADY
I
AM
now
I
thanke
God
soe
well
rid
of
my
paine
that
I
am
able
to
give
you
an
acount
at
larg
of
all
the
busines
you
wright
about
which
I
had
done
sooner
but
that
I
reseaved
not
your
letter
which
I
imagine
should
have
come
on
Wednesday
or
Thursday
as
they
use
to
doe

I
went
sins
to
visit
Mrs
Dickson
and
in
discors
fell
upon
the
ould
busines
but
she
made
answer
ther
was
no
good
to
be
done
for
the
two
elder
daughters
ther
was
now
a
treaty
of
marage
betwene
my
Lord
North’s
sone
for
one
and
Sir
Gervis
Clifton's
for
another
and
the
third
was
too
young

I
asked
her
what
her
portion
was
she
tould
me
she
had
one
thousand
pounds
in
money
and
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
land
of
inheritans
and
they
valued
this
at
five
thousand
pounds
or
therabouts

I
made
answer
I
had
not
heard
any thing
of
it
from
you
but
I
thought
you
would
not
aksept
of
soe
small
a
portion
with
any body
besides
you
would
rather
have
money
then
land
but
this
I
said
from
myself

You
may
give
what
answer
you
please
and
if
you
like
not
of
it
you
need
retorne
noe
answer
to
Mr
Chitting
for
I
have
putt
off
my
Lady
Barrington
from
any
hope
of
it
tharfore
if
pleas
you
let
Mr
Chitting
say
nothing
that
he
hath
acquainted
you
with
it
becaus
I
think
you
will
denie
it
and
I
would
have
nothing
hinder
the
proseding
of
a
busines
which
I
have
some
hope
may
come
to
good
which
is
this
As
I
was
with
my
Lady
Barrington
ther
came
in
Sir
William
Curtene
a
Dutchman
and
two
of
his
daughters
the
one
of
which
was
soe
conveniently
handsome
that
I
wished
her
my
cosin's
wife
if
shee
had
ten
thousand
pounds
to
which
Lady
Barrington
answered
they
were
reported
to
have
so
much
a
piece
and
ther
father
might
give
them
more
if
he
liked
the
condicions
for
he
is
very
rich

I
asked
the
lady
if
shee
had
so
much
intrest
in
them
as
to
propound
such
a
business
with
hope
of
suckses
and
whether
she
would
be
pleased
to
favor
her
frends
soe
much
as
to
doe
it
to
which
she
answered
she
had
some
power
ther
and
would
use
her
best
endeavors
if
she
might
reseave
full
coition
from
me
which
I
must
first
reseave
from
you
and
so
will
prosede
by
your
direction

Now
to
give
you
some
acount
of
your
frends
and
servants
here
of
which
my
mother
is
one
that
retornes
you
many
thankes
for
your
kind
wishes
to
her
and
her
busines
in
which
yet
we
can
do
nothing

The
letter
you
sent
my
cosin
Meautys
was
unsealed

You
sent
three
open
one
to
him
one
to
Sir
William
Plaiters
and
one
to
me
but
I
delivered
them
to
them
both
with
my
own
hands
and
I
think
they
both
beleved
I
looked
not
in
them
for
if
I
did
not
my
cosin
was
very
testy
at
the
reseaving
of
it
which
had
I
known
I
would
have
sealed
it
for
him

I
think
he
meanes
to
come
quarrell
with
you
for
it
if
he
can
find
noe
greater
matter
for
he
intends
to
come
to
you
as
soon
as
the
tearme
is
done

MY
MOST
HONORED
LADY
THERE
was
one
question
my
Lady
Barrington
asked
me
when
she
was
in
towne
that
I
would
desire
to
be
provided
of
answer
from
you
for
her
against
she
come

She
desired
to
know
if
Sir
William
Curteen
asked
what
portion
you
would
demand
what
she
should
say

We
looke
for
her
every
day
and
my
cosin
Meautys's
man
put
me
in
hope
I
should
see
you
here
between
this
and
Easter
which
was
very
welcome
newes
to
me

I
have
enquired
after
matches
in
other
places
if
this
should
faile
but
can
hear
of
none
but
some
of
the
nobility
which
I
harkened
not
to
becaus
I
thinke
you
desire
not
to
match
with
them
yet
thear
was
one
Lord
whoes
daughters
weare
so
much
cōmended
to
me
that
I
did
not
absolutely
denie
it
but
thought
good
to
let
you
know

It
is
my
Lord
of
Bridgwater
and
Sir
Henry
St.
George
is
he
propounded
it
whoe
is
well
acquainted
with
him
and
thinkes
he
will
give
six
thousand
pounds

When
you
come
I
hope
you
will
met
with
one
to
your
liking
which
I
hope
will
be
shortly
till
which
time
and
ever
I
am
and
will
be

MADAM
IT
is
much
your
goodnes
if
I
am
not
within
your
censure
of
too
much
negligence
that
I
have
not
all
this
while
given
you
some
account
of
that
employment
you
honored
me
withall
whearin
my
intentions
wear
soe
reall
to
serve
you
that
I
was
loth
to
saye
any thing
untill
I
wear
better
satisfied
which
I
expected
to
have
found
in
more
forwardnes
then
I
see
although
I
gave
them
time
to
consider
of
it
from
the
end
of
last
terme
till
now
and
although
I
have
but
a
little
while
to
staye
now
in
London
I
sett
this
afternoone
apart
for
a
visett
thear
that
I
might
thorowly
understand
their
resolutions
which
are
that
the
daughter
must
not
think
of
marriage
untill
her
brother's
returne
from
France
which
will
be

springe

To
my

at

this

MY
MOST
HONORED
LADY
THE
Lady
Barrington
made
soe
short
a
stay
in
London
after
the
receipt
of
your
letter
that
shee
could
doe
littell
in
the
busines
what
shee
did
I
hope
she
hath
or
will
shortly
let
you
know
yet
I
thought
fitt
to
tell
you
what
I
know
conserning
it
from
her

Shee
went
to
the
father
and
tould
him
that
out
of
her
loue
to
him
and
the
good
opinion
she
had
of
his
daughter
she
came
to
propound
a
worthy
match
to
him
for
her
which
she
knew
he
would
giue
her
thanckes
for
when
he
knew
wher
it
was
which
before
he
should
doe
she
desired
to
know
if
she
weare
free
or
he
had
noe
treaty
with
any
for
her
to
which
he
replied
he
could
not
yet
giue
her
any
answer
but
retorned
her
many
thankes
for
her
offer
though
I
thinke
he
knew
not
whoe
it
was
she
wished
him

She
is
extreame
sory
she
could
doe
noe
more
in
it
now
but
at
the
next
tearme
she
will
be
heare
againe
and
then
shee
tould
me
she
would
doe
you
the
best
seruis
she
could
in
the
meane time
if
I
heare
of
any
other
I
will
lett
you
know
of
it
for
I
doe
most
ernestly
desire
to
se
him
maried
becaues
I
persaued
a
wandring
humor
in
him
when
he
was
at
London
and
a
resolution
this
spring
to
goe
into
France
yet
not
without

MY
MOST
HONORED
LADY
I
MUCH
wonder
the
Lady
Barrington
reseaved
so
drie
an
answer
from
Curtene
for
shee
was
very
confident
it
would
have
bene
thankfully
entertained
and
that
an
extraordinary
portion
would
have
bene
given
because
shee
knew
he
gave
five
thousand
pounds
with
a
daughter
to
one
that
had
but
twelve
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
shee
thought
he
would
give
ratably
according
to
the
estate
but
this
is
the
cause
I
perseave
why
he
makes
a
stay
he
hath
a
brother
latly
dead
in
the
Low
Contryes
and
his
sone
is
gone
thither
to
see
how
things
are
and
till
his
retorne
he
will
conclude
of
nothing
for
it
is
reported
he
hath
left
him
forty
or
fifty
thousand
pounds
and
then
he
will
looke
very
hie
for
his
daughters
yet
Lady
Barrington
said
he
gave
her
many
thankes
and
did
not
at
all
refues
but
made
a
stay
but
it
is
not
worth
your
further
expectation

1629-30

tells
me
which
I
reseaved
with
the
dainty
pott
of
jely
for
which
as
for
the
rest
of
your
favors
I
can
only
retorne
thankes
and
continue
constantly
yours

I
sent
a
letter
to
you
last
weeke
fastened
to
a
little
box
which
I
make
question
whether
you
reseaved
or
noe
becaus
I
heard
nothing

Ther
was
some
busines
concerning
my
Lady
Barrington
who
will
be
in
towne
by
the
time
this

come
to
you
and
I
know
not
whether
your
resolution
hould
conserning
the
match
she
propounded
or
noe
and
I
am
suer
she
will
aske
me
whether
she
shall
prosede
in
it
which
I
will
say
nothing
to
till
I
hear
from
you

I
heare
of

If

might
be
meanes
found
to
propound
it

soary
to

that
wherby

made
himself
so
pleasing

shall
extend
themselfs
in

both
towards

towards
you
(
if
you
will
make

of
them
as
at

your

acknolledge
that

for

Cornwalies
came
to
me
but
not
Sir
Fredrick
for
he
plaies
least
in
sight
for
feare
I
thinke
that
I
should
tell
him
his
owne
but
I
am
like
to
doe
it
the
more
next
time
I
see
him

I
tould
his
Lady
the
manner
of
his
carage
at
Brome
and
that
it
was
his
own
fault
he
came
away
upon
noe
better
termes

She
professes
she
knowes
his
hart
much
desires
a
sincere
reconcilment
and
the
contrary
if
it
continue
soe
will
shorten
his
life
yet
I
perseave
not
him
to
be
soe
forward
as
she
but
I
know
nothing
but
that
he
is
soe
backward
to
come
to
me
where
he
might
further
that
he
soe
much
desires

It
will
be
too
tedious
to
committ
to
wrighting
all
that
passed
betwene
my
Lady
Cornwalies
and
me
only
this
in
generall
she
much
desires
as
she
saieth
still
to
doe
any thing
that
might
give
you
satisfaction

My
Lady
was
afraid
any thing
that
she
should
writ
would
be
unpleasing
to
you
but
I
strived
to
perswade
her
from
that
becaus
if
you
should
accept
any thing
that
she
offers
you
might
have
it
under
her
owne
hand
for
she
might
forget
what
she
saied
to
me
and
I
might
be
accused
for
mistaking

I
thinke
you
weare
never
trobled
with
so
tedious
a
letter
and
therfore
now
I
will
conclude
with
a
hartie
wish
of
all
hapines
to
you
and
yours
and
soe
sweet
Madam
ons
more
farewell

joyfull
of

In
that
I
was
soe
far
remote
from
you
I
must
confess
it
did
grieve
me
in
that
my
being
was
so
long
in
England
but
now
since
it
hath
pleased
God
to
bring

so
far
as
London
in
my

aquaint
you
with
the
bissines
concerning
Sir
Alexander
Radcliffe
and
my
Lady
as
yet
I
understand
by
them
how
their
estate
is
so
much
encombered
first
by
the
occasion
of
their
debtes
and
then
the
redeeming
of
their
land
the
which
her
father
mortgaged
unto
the
very
dores
of
his
house
that
until
such
time
as
their
own
estate
be
settled
they
saye
they
shall
not
be
able
to
establish
any
sartintie
upon
me
or
mine
but
so
soone
as
they
can
take
order
for
it
which
this
terme
they
intend
to
do
then
they
have
both
promised
me
seriously
they
will
not
faile
to
performe
all
that
they
can
for
me

For
them
I
wish
them
much
happines
and
I
must
acknowledge
I
have
bine
very
kindly
entertained
of
them
both
all
the
time
of
my
being
there

Now
deare
Sister
when
you
shall
see
them
in
my
absence
will
you
please
to
put

of
me
for
their
intent
is
to
see
you
this
somer

Deare
Sister
I
must
confess
that
I
am
ashamed
now
againe
to
trubble
you
but
my
necessitie
is
such
occasioned
by
my
living
and
teduous
travels
that
I
must
intrete
you
to
if

MOST
DEARE
SlSTER
THESE
are
to
intreate
you
that
in
my
absence
you
would
be
pleased
to
show
this
letter
to
Sir
Alexander
and
my
Lady
when
they
shall
come
unto
you
which
is
to
remember
them
of
those
promises
made
unto
me
at
my
being
with
them

The
first
was
my
Lady
whom
I
did
acquaint
I
telling
her
how
much
my
case
was
to
be
commisserated
the
promises
of
my
Lord
and
her
mother
being
now
violated
the
which
they
had
with
soe
many
solemn
protestations
vowed
to
performe
to
me
concerning
the
jointure
of
200£
a
yeare
and
that
if
it
should
please
God
to
take
away
my
husband
what
would
become
of
me
and
my
poore
children
and
withall
I
told
her
how
much
I
did
relie
upon
her
goodnes
whom
I
did
assure
myselfe
did
love
me
soe
well
that
she
would
take
my
case
into
her
consideration
she
said
she
would
do
what
might
be
done
for
me
and
that
she
would
tell
Sir
Alexander
of
it
who
she
knew
would
not
be
against
any
good
that
she
should
intend
to
any
kindred
of
hers

Then
I
did
breake
with
him
myselfe
and
I
must
confes
I
found
him
very
noble
in
his
answer
sayeing
that
soe
soone
as
he
had
but
settled
his
bissines
which
he
hoped
to
dispach
this
terme
he
would
conferme
something
upon
me
which
he
said
must
be
some
of
his
own
inheritance
for
the
rest
he
said
was
all
intailed
only
Diss
upon
his
sone
which
is
80
£
a
yeare

He
did
solemnly
swear
to
me
he
would
not
faile
to
do
for
me
all
that
laye
in
his
power
and
soe
did
my
Lady
too
soe
that
when
they
have
settled
their
occasions
that
then
they
will
really
conferme
something
upon
me

I
and
mine
shall
be
ever
obliged
to
them
and
I
am
assured
God
will
prosper
them
the
better
for
their
charitable
performance

And
soe
beseeching
you
to
be
an
assistance
to
me
in
this
bissines
I
shall
now

Madam
I
think
it
best
not

know
whear
he
bee

Now

in
the
worlde
to
saye
to
this
marchant
for
the
presente
I
knowe
not
becas
they
say
that
if
bills
bee
not
presently
paide
heare
thay
send
back
and
protest
them
thear
and
then
nobody

trust
them

any thinge

Now
if
that
wod
bring
him

it
weare
noe
matter

I
tould

awhile
then
for
any
hops
that
I
hade
of

munny
becas
I
think
thear
is
more
paide
alredy

and
for
him
then
is
dwe
to
him

the

of
June
1634

To
my
very
loving
friend
Mr.

the
Sign
of
the
Dog
in
the
Royal
Exchange
London
Deliver
these

MR

Building
of
hospitals
provides
for
men's
bodies
to
build
material
temples
is
judged
a
work
of
piety
but
they
that
procure
spiritual
food
they
that
build
up
spiritual
temples
they
are
the
men
truly
charitable
truly
pious

Such
a
work
as
this
was
your
erecting
the
Lecture
in
our
Country
in
the
which
you
placed
Dr.
Wells
a
man
of
goodness
and
industry
and
ability
to
do
good
every
way
not
short
of
any
I
know
in
England
and
I
am
persuaded
that
sithence
his
coming
the
Lord
hath
by
him
wrought
much
good
among
us

It
only
remains
how
that
He
who
first
moved
you
to
this
put
you
forward
in
the
continuance
thereof
it
was
the
Lord
and
therefore
to
Him
lift
we
up
our
hearts
that
He
would
perfect
it

And
surely
Mr.
Storie
it
were
a
piteous
thing
to
see
a
Lecture
fall
in
the
hands
of
so
many
able
and
godly
men
as
I
am
persuaded
the
founders
of
this
are
in
these
times
wherein
we
see
they
are
suppressed
with
too
much
haste
and
violence
by
the
enemies
of
God
his
Truth

Far
be
it
that
so
much
guilt
should
stick
to
your
hands
who
live
in
a
City
so
renowned
for
the
clear
shining
light
of
the
Gospel

You
know
Mr.
Storie
to
withdraw
the
pay
is
to
let
fall
the
Lecture
for
who
goeth
to
warfare
at
his
own
cost

I
beseech
you
therefore
in
the
bowels
of
Jesus
Christ
put
it
forward
and
let
the
good
man
have
his
pay

The
souls
of
God's
children
will
bless
you
for
it
and
so
shall
I
and
ever
rest

DEERE
MOTHER
IT
was
your
favore
to
me
that
made
me
sende
to

to
inquire
after
my

which
I
shulde
be
much
to
blame
to
neglect
without
just
excuse
sins
you
are
pleased
to
give
them
so
good
acceptans
but
I
beleave
the
carriers
or
some
belonging
to
them
very
faulty

I
am
sure
they
have
been
so
to
me
this
winter

I
had
my
man
Woddull
at
Newmarket
this
weak
and
it
was
sum
trubble
to
my
mind
that
he
shuld
com
so
neere
and
not
waite
of
yor

but
his
bisnes
was
not
mine

my
Lady

for
she
borrod
him
to
go
to

upon
the
report
that
the

Madam
I
humbly
thanck
you

all
which
I
beseech
God
to
rewarde
you
for
us
all
with
His
saving
grace
and
I
beleave
that

my

yor
Lap

I
shud
a
bene
glad

wod
a
bene
cleane
well
but
I
heare
he

Satterday
therefore
I
will
not
write
to
him

Madam
I
have
not
seene
Mr

but
I
did
much
feare
that
he
wod
be
so
neare
coming
up
when
my
husband
came
down
that
there
wod
be
nothing
now
don
in
his
bisnes
and
Mr
Morse
tould
me
that
yor
Lap
might
have
assurance
and
the
remainder
settled
there
as
well
as
here
which
I
was
very
glad
of
for
I
know
yor
Lap
cannot
com
here
but
with
much
trubble
and
charge
and
we
had
nede
be
as
sparing
of
that
as
we
can
in
small
matters
sins
nesessity
forses
us
to
crave
yor
assistans
in
so
great
a
proportion
for
trewly
Madam
if
you
do
not
helpe
I
much
feare
all
will
be
naught

But
trewly
Madam
my
husband
is
very
good
but
if
he
put
his
estat
into
a
stranger's
hand
I
shall
never
looke
to
see
any
part
of
it
againe
but
for
yor
favor
to
me
in
desiring
to
keep
my
joynture
free
I
cannot
saye
enuff
but
I
shall
laye
it
up
in
a
thankful
harte
with
yor
many
other
kindnesses

But
I
hope
my
husband
will
be
willing
to
give
yor
Lap
any
assurance
that
you
pleas

My

Truly
Madam
I
did
much
feare
your
being
very
wery
of
so
long
and
solitary
a
jurny
and
my
husband
said
that
he
was
sorry
he
was
putt
to
ask
to
stay
for
that
case
staies
him
still
in
town
as
he
says
to
me
for
I
have
not
as
yet
seen
him
sins
that
day
that
you
wente
out
of
towne
but
he
on
Sunday
sent
Mr
Tom
Howard
to
me
that
I
would
be
reddy
to
goe
into
the
beginning
of
the
nexte
weeke

I
sent
him
worde
I
would
do
what
I
could
but
now
I
thinke
I
shall
not
come
so
soone
because
the
Queene
is
now
resolved
to
stay
hear
till
Michlemas
and
I
have
been
some
times
away
of
late
so
that
I
shude
do
well
to
wait
a
fortnight
or
3
weeks
and
besides
I
wod
willingly
know
what
will
become
of
my
mother's
appearle
affair
so
that
I
wrote
to
my
husband
by
this
messenger
not
to
stay
for
me
after
he
have
dispatched
his
owne
affayres
and
when
I
am
coming
down
I
will
beg
the
favor
of
your
cotche's
meeting
me
at
Madam
I
can
say
nothing
of
Sir
Tho.
only
as
soone
as
you
were
gone
he
went
to
lead
me
up
to
your
chamber
and
then
he
said
to
me
and
I
to
him
as
before
and
soe
he
went
away
and
I
saw
him
noe
more

Then
my
husband
and
I
went
to
bed
into
your
bed
and
at
nine
o'clock
I
rose
and
sent
for
Mr
Morse
who
read
all
the
writings
to
my
husband
as
he
lay
and
then
he
sealed
them
and
bade
Mr
Morse
put
them
with
the
writings

I
wished
the
fine
and
all
had
bene
passed
but
I
hope
it
will

The
King

It

I
beceach
the

to
continue
your

and
aboue
all
to
giue
you
that
grase
in
your

which

industrious
in

in
which
good
is

I
am
glad

of

inioye
labor
to
keepe
a
fresch
desire
affter
the
sincere
milke
of
the

and
then
in
good
time
you
shall
inioye
that
bllesing
againe

The
Lord
has
promised
to
giue
his
spirit
to
his
chillderen
which
shall
leade
them
in
the

Begge
that
bllesed
Spirit
and
then
errors
will
but
make
the

more
bright
as
the

My

as

will
not
easely
be
tuched
without
leaufeing
some
spot

I
had
not
hard
of
Duke
Roberts
and
my
Lord
Crauens
being
taken

I
hope
the
news
of
the
Sweeds
is
not
true
but
in
all
theas
things
we
must
remember
the
warneing
which
our
Sauiour
has
guien
us
when
he
had
toold
his
decipels
that
theare
must
be
wars
and
rumers
of
wars
(
but
he
saith
let
not
your
harts
be
trubled
in
my
aprehention
as
if
Christ
had
saide
greate
trubells
and
wars
must
be
both
to
purg
his
chruch
of
ipocrits
and
that
his
enimies
at
the
last
may
be
vtterly
distroyed
but
you
my
saruants
be
not
carefull
for
your selfs
you
are
my
jewells
and
the
days
of
trubbell
are
the
days
when
I
take
care
of
jewells
and
my
deare
Ned
tho
I
fermely
beleeue
theare
will
be
great
trubells
yet
I
looke
with
ioy
beyond
those
days
of
trubell
considering
the
glory
that
the
Lord
will
bring
his
chruch
to
and
happy
are
they
that
shall
liue
to
see
it
which
I
hope
you
will
doo

Present

DEAR
COUSIN
Ely
13th
October
1638

I
thankfully
acknowledge
your
love
in
your
kind
remembrance
of
me
upon
this
opportunity

Alas
you
do
too
highly
prize
my
lines
and
my
company
I
may
be
ashamed
to
own
your
expressions
considering
how
unprofitable
I
am
and
the
mean
improvement
of
my
talent

Yet
to
honour
my
God
by
declaring
what
He
hath
done
for
my
soul
in
this
I
am
confident
and
I
will
be
so

Though
He
do
prolong
yet
He
will
I
trust
bring
me
to
His
tabernacel
to
His
resting-place

My
soul
is
with
the
Congregation
of
the
Firstborn
my
body
rests
in
hope
and
if
here
I
may
honour
my
God
either
by
doing
or
by
suffering
I
shall
be
most
glad

Truly
no
poor
creature
hath
more
cause
to
put
himself
forth
in
the
cause
of
his
God
than
I

I
have
had
plentiful
wages
beforehand
and
I
am
sure
I
shall
never
earn
the
least
mite

The
Lord
accept
me
in
His
Son
and
give
me
to
walk
in
the
light
and
give
us
to
walk
in
the
light
as
He
is
the
light

He
it
is
that
enlighteneth
our
blackness
our
darkness

I
dare
not
say
He
hideth
His
face
from
me

He
giveth
me
to
see
light
in
His
light

Oh
I
lived
in
and
loved
darkness
and
hated
light
I
was
a
chief
the
chief
of
sinners

This
is
true
I
hated
godliness
yet
God
had
mercy
on
me

O
the
riches
of
His
mercy

begun
a
good
work
would
perfect
it
in
the
day
of
Christ

Salute
all
my
friends
in
that
Family
whereof
you
are
yet
a
member

I
am
much
bound
unto
them
for
their
love

I
bless
the
Lord
for
them
and
that
my
Son
by
their
procurement
is
so
well

Let
him
have
your
prayers
your
counsel
let
me
have
them

Once
more
farewell

The
Lord
be
with
you
so
prayeth
Your
truly
loving

MR

BARNARD
`Huntingdon,'
23d
January
1642

It's
most
true
my
Lieutenant
with
some
other
soldiers
of
my
troop
were
at
your
House

I
dealt
‘so’
freely
‘as’
to
inquire
after
you
the
reason
was
I
had
heard
you
reported
active
against
the
proceedings
of
Parliament
and
for
those
that
disturb
the
peace
of
this
Country
and
the
Kingdom
with
those
of
this
Country
who
have
had
meetings
not
a
few
to
intents
and
purposes
too-too
full
of
suspect

It's
true
Sir
I
know
you
have
been
wary
in
your
carriages
be
not
too
confident
thereof

Subtlety
may
deceive
you
integrity
never
will

With
my
heart
I
shall
desire
that
your
judgment
may
alter
and
your
practice

I
come
only
to
hinder
men
from
increasing
the
rent
from
doing
hurt
but
not
to
hurt
any
man
nor
shall
I
you
I
hope
you
will
give
me
no
cause

Be
assured
fair
words
from
me
shall
neither
deceive
you
of
your
houses
nor
of
your
liberty

To
all

every
Inhabitants

WHEREAS
we
have
been
enforced
by
apparent
grounds
of
approaching
danger
to
begin
to
fortify
the
Town
of
Cambridge
for
preventing
the
Enemy's
inroad

the

maintain
the

this
County
Having
in

your
good

the

and
now
standing
in
need
of
your
further
assistance
to
the
perfecting
of
the
said
Fortifications
which
will
cost
at
least
Two-thousand
pounds
We
are
encouraged
as
well
as
necessitated
to
desire
a
Freewill

Contribution

already

We

what
shall

given
and
collected
may
with
all
convenient
speed
be
sent
to

Commissioners
at
Cambridge
to
be
employed
to

Cambridge
this

of

1642

I
am
sorry
I
should
so
often
trouble
you
about
the
business
of
money
it's
no
pleasant
subject
to
be
too
frequent
upon

But
such
is
Captain
Nelson's
occasion
for
want
thereof
that
he
hath
not
wherewith
to
satisfy
for
the
billet
of
his
soldiers
and
so
this
Business
for
Norfolk
so
hopeful
to
set
all
right
there
may
fail

Truly
he
hath
borrowed
from
me
else
he
could
not
have
paid
to
discharge
this
Town
at
his
departure

It's
a
pity
a
Gentleman
of
his
affections
should
be
discouraged

Wherefore
I
earnestly
beseech
you
to
consider
him
and
the
Cause

It's
honourable
that
you
do
so

What
you
can
help
to
be
pleased
to
send
into
Norfolk
he
hath
not
wherewith
to
pay
a
Troop
one
day
as
he
tells
me

Let
your
return
be
speedy

Norwich

the
Mayor

Gentlemen
'Cambridge,'
23d
March
1642

Upon
the
coming
down
of
your
Townsmen
to
Cambridge
Captain
Langley
not
knowing
how
to
dispose
of
them
desired
me
to
nominate
a
fit
Captain
which
I
did
an
honest
religious
valiant
Gentleman
Captain
Dodsworth
the
Bearer
hereof

He
hath
diligently
attended
the
service
and
much
improved
his
men
in
their
exercise
but
hath
been
unhappy
beyond
others
in
not
receiving
any
pay
for
himself
and
what
he
had
for
his
soldiers
is
out
long
ago

He
hath
by
his
prudence
what
with
fair
and
winning
carriage
what
with
money
borrowed
kept
them
together

He
is
able
to
do
so
no
longer
they
will
presently
disband
if
a
course
be
not
taken

It's
a
pity
it
should
be
so

For
I
believe
they
are
brought
into
as
good
order
as
most
Companies
in
the
Army

Besides
at
this
instant
there
is
great
need
to
use
them
I
have
received
a
special
command
from
my
Lord
General
To
advance
with
what
force
we
can
to
put
an
end
if
it
may
be
to
this
Work
God
so
assisting
from
whom
all
help
cometh

one
month's
pay
may
prove
all
your
trouble

I
speak
to
wise
men
God
direct
you

I
rest
Yours
to
serve
you

William

Baronet

Maurice
Barrow
Esquire
Present
these

I
have
been
now
two
days
at
Cambridge
in
expectation
to
hear
the
fruit
of
your
endeavours
in
Suffolk
towards
the
public
assistance

Believe
it
you
will
hear
of
a
storm
in
few
days

You
have
no
Infantry
at
all
considerable
hasten
your
Horses
a
few
hours
may
undo
you
neglected

I
beseech
you
be
careful
what
Captains
of
Horse
you
choose
what
men
be
mounted
a
few
honest
men
are
better
than
numbers

The
King
is
exceeding
strong
in
the
West

If
you
be
able
to
foil
a
force
at
the
first
coming
of
it
you
will
have
reputation
and
that
is
of
great
advantage
in
our
affairs

God
hath
given
it
to
our
handful
let
us
endeavour
to
keep
it

I
had
rather
have
a
plain
russet-coated
Captain
that
knows
what
he
fights
for
and
loves
what
he
knows
than
that
which
you
call
"
a
Gentleman
and
is
nothing
else

I
honour
a
Gentleman
I
understand
Mr.
Margery
hath
honest
men
will
follow
him
if
so
be
pleased
to
make
use
of
him
it
much
concerns
your
good
to
have
conscientious
men

I
understand
that
there
is
an
Order
for
me
to
have
3000
out
of
the
Association
and
Essex
hath
sent
their
part
or
near
it

I
assure
you
we
need
exceedingly

I
hope
to
find
your
favour
and
respect

P.S

If
you
send
such
men
as
Essex
hath
sent
it
will
be
to
little
purpose

Be
pleased
to
take
care
of
their
march
and
that
such
may
come
along
with
them
as
will
be
able
to
bring
them
to
the
main
Body
and
then
I
doubt
not
but
we
shall
keep
them
and
make
good
use
of
them

I
beseech
you
give
countenance
to
Mr.
Margery

Help
him
in
raising
his
Troop
let
him
not

whatsoever
is

If
he

Of
all
men
I
should
not
trouble
you
with
money
matters
-
did
not
the
heavy
necessities
my
Troops
are
in
press
me
beyond
measure

Many
of
my
Lord
of
Manchester's
Troops
are
come
to
me
very
to
a
week
almost
mine
noways
provided-for
to
support
them
except
by
the
poor
Sequestrations
of
the
County
of
Huntingdon

My
Troops
increase

I
have
a
lovely
company
you
would
respect
them
did
you
know
them

They
are
no
"
Anabaptists
they
are
honest
sober
Christians
they
expect
to
be
used
as
men

If
I
took
pleasure
to
write
to
the
House
in
bitterness
I
have
occasion

'Of'
the
3,000
l.
allotted
to
me
I
cannot
get
the
Norfolk
part
nor
the
Hertfordshire
it
was
gone
before
I
had
it

I
have
minded
your
service
to
forgetfulness
of
my
own
and
Soldiers'
necessities

I
desire
not
to
seek
myself
but
I
have
little
money
of
my
own
to
help
my
Soldiers

You
have
had
my
money
I
hope
in
God
I
desire
to
venture
my
skin

So
do
mine

Lay
weight
upon
their
patience
but
break
it
not

Think
of
that
which
may
be
a
real
help

I
believe
5,000
l.
is
due

If
you
lay
aside
the
thought
of
me
and
my
Letter
I
expect
no
help

28th
September
1643

It
hath
pleased
God
to
bring
off
Sir
Thomas
Fairfax
his
Horse
over
the
river
from
Hull
being
about
One-and-twenty
Troops
of
Horse
and
Dragoons

The
Lincolnshire
Horse
laboured
to
hinder
this
work
being
about
Thirty-four
Colours
of
Horse
and
Dragoons
we
marched
up
to
their
landing-place
and
the
Lincolnshire
Horse
retreated

After
they
were
come
over
we
all
marched
towards
Holland
and
when
we
came
to
our
last
quarter
upon
the
edge
of
Holland
the
Enemy
quartered
within
four
miles
of
us
and
kept
the
field
all
night
with
his
whole
body
his
intendment
as
we
conceive
was
to
fight
us
or
hoping
to
interpose
betwixt
us
and
our
retreat
having
received
to
his
Thirty-four
Colours
of
Horse
Twenty
fresh
Troops
ten
Companies
of
'Dragoons;'
and
about
a
Thousand
Foot
being
General
King's
own
Regiment

With
these
he
attempted
our
guards
and
our
quarters
and
if
God
had
not
been
merciful
had
ruined
us
before
we
had
known
of
it
the
Five
Troops
we
set
to
keep
the
watch
failing
much
of
their
duty

I
write
unto
you
to
acquaint
you
with
this
the
rather
that
God
may
be
acknowledged
and
that
you
may
help
forward
in
sending
such
force
away
unto
us
as
lie
unprofitably
in
your
country

And
especially
that
Troop
of
Captain
Margery's
which
surely
would
not
be
wanting
now
we
so
much
need
it

I
hear
there
hath
been
much
exception
taken
to
Captain
Margery
and
his
Officers
for
taking
of
horses

I
am
sorry
you
should
discountenance
those
who
(
not
to
make
benefit
to
themselves
but
to
serve
their
Country
are
willing
to
venture
their
lives
and
to
purchase
to
themselves
the
displeasure
of
bad
men
that
they
may
do
a
Public
benefit

I
undertake
not
to
justify
all
Captain
Margery's
actions
but
his
own
conscience
knows
whether
he
hath
taken
the
horses
of
any
but
Malignants
and
it
were
somewhat
too
hard
to
put
it
upon
the
consciences
of
your
fellow
Deputy
Lieutenants
whether
they
have
not
freed
the
horses
of
known
Malignants

A
fault
not
less
considering
the
sad
estate
of
this
Kingdom
than
to
take
a
horse
from
a
known
Honest
man
the
offence
being
against
the
Public
which
is
a
considerable
aggravation

I
know
not
the
measures
everyone
takes
of
Malignants

I
think
it
is
not
fit
Captain
Margery
should
be
the
judge
but
if
he
in
his
taking
of
horses
hath
observed
the
plain
character
of
a
Malignant
and
cannot
be
charged
for
one
horse
otherwise
taken
it
had
been
better
that
some
of
the
bitterness
wherewith
he
and
his
have
been
followed
had
been
spared

I'll
bid
them
welcome

And
when
they
have
fought
for
you
and
endured
some
other
difficulties
of
war
which
your
"
honester
men
will
hardly
bear
I
pray
you
then
let
them
go
for
honest
men

I
protest
unto
you
many
of
those
men
which
are
of
your
Countrey's
choosing
under
Captain
Johnson
are
so
far
from
serving
you
that
were
it
not
that
I
have
honest
Troops
to
master
them
although
they
be
well
paid
yet
they
are
so
mutinous
that
I
may
justly
fear
they
would
cut
my
throat

--
Gentlemen
it
may
be
it
provokes
some
spirits
to
see
such
plain
men
made
Captains
of
Horse

It
had
been
well
that
men
of
honour
but
why
do
they
not
appear

Who
would
have
hindered
them

But
seeing
it
was
necessary
the
work
must
go
on
better
plain
men
than
none
but
best
to
have
men
patient
of
wants
faithful
and
conscientious
in
their
employment

And
such
I
hope
these
will
approve
themselves
to
be

And
I
believe
before
it
be
long
you
will
be
in
their
debt
and
then
it
will
not
be
hard
to
quit
scores

What
arms
you
can
furnish
them
withal
I
beseech
you
do
it

I
have
hitherto
found
your
kindness
great
to
me
I
know
not
what
I
have
done
to
lose
it
I
love
it
so
well
and
price
it
so
high
that
I
would
do
my
best
to
gain
more

You
have
the
assured
affection
of
Your
most
humble
and
faithful
servant

P.S

I
understand
there
were
some
exceptions
taken
at
a
horse
that
was
sent
to
me
which
was
seized
out
of
the
hands
of
one
Mr
Goldsmith
of
Wilby

If
he
be
not
by
you
judged
a
Malignant
and
that
you
do
not
approve
of
my
having
of
the
Horse
I
shall
as
willingly
return
him
again
as
you
shall
desire

And
therefore
I
pray
you
signify
your
pleasure
to
me
herein
under
your
hands

Or
if
he
be
unwilling
to
part
with
him
but
keeps
him
for
his
own
pleasure
be
pleased
to
send
me
an
answer
thereof
I
shall
instantly
return
him
his
Horse
and
do
it
with
a
great
deal
more
satisfaction
to
myself
than
keep
him

Therfore
I
beg
it
of
you
to
satisfy
my
desire
in
this
last
request
it
shall
exceedingly
oblige
me
to
you

If
you
do
it
not
I
shall
rest
very
unsatisfied
and
the
Horse
will
be
a
burden
to
me
so
long
as
I
shall
keep
him

SIR
The
complaints
you
preferred
to
my
lord
against
your
Lieutenant-Colonel
both
by
Mr.
Lee
and
your
own
letters
have
occasioned
his
stay
here
my
Lord
being
'so'
employed
in
regard
of
many
occasions
which
are
upon
him
that
he
hath
not
been
at
leisure
to
hear
him
make
his
defence
which
in
pure
justice
ought
to
be
granted
him
or
any
man
before
a
judgment
be
passed
upon
him

During
his
abode
here
and
absence
from
you
he
hath
acquainted
me
what
a
grief
it
is
to
him
to
be
absent
from
his
charge
especially
now
the
regiment
is
called
forth
to
action
and
therefore
asking
of
me
my
opinion
I
advised
him
speedily
to
repair
unto
you

Surely
you
are
not
well
advised
thus
to
turn
off
one
so
faithful
to
the
cause
and
so
able
to
serve
you
as
this
man
is

Give
me
leave
to
tell
you
I
cannot
be
of
your
judgment
'cannot
understand
if
a
man
notorious
for
wickedness
for
oaths
for
drinking
hath
as
great
a
share
in
your
affection
as
one
who
fears
an
oath
who
fears
to
sin
that
this
doth
commend
your
election
Ay
but
the
man
"
is
an
Anabaptist

Are
you
sure
of
that

It
may
be
so
in
some
things
we
have
all
human
infirmities

I
tell
you
if
you
had
none
but
such
"
indiscreet
men
about
you
and
would
be
pleased
to
use
them
kindly
you
would
find
as
good
a
fence
to
you
as
any
you
have
yet
chosen

Sir
the
State
in
choosing
men
to
serve
it
takes
no
notice
of
their
opinions
if
they
be
willing
faithfully
to
serve
it
that
satisfies

I
advised
you
formerly
to
bear
with
men
of
different
minds
from
yourself
if
you
had
done
it
when
I
advised
you
to
it
I
think
you
would
not
have
had
so
many
stumblingblocks
in
your
way

It
may
be
you
judge
otherwise
but
I
tell
you
my
mind

I
desire
you
would
receive
this
man
into
your
favour
and
opinion

I
believe
if
he
follow
my
counsel
he
will
deserve
no
other
but
respect
from
you

Take
heed
of
being
sharp
or
too
easily
sharpened
by
others
against
those
to
whom
you
can
object
little
but
that
they
square
not
with
you
in
every
opinion
concerning
matters
of
religion

I
question
whether
you
or
I
have
any
precedent
for
that

I
have
no
further
to
trouble
you
but
rest

17th

I
have

two
Letters
one
from
my
lord
of
Manchester
the
other
from
yourself
much
to
the

effect
I
hope

one
answer
will
serve
them
both

Which
is
in
short
this
what
we
know
you
are
disaffected
to
the
Parliament

truly
if

MY
LORDS
AND
GENTELEMEN
'Lincolnshire,'
3d
May
1643

I
must
needs
be
hardly
thought
on
because
I
am
still
the
messenger
of
unhappy
tidings
and
delays
concerning
you
though
I
know
my
heart
is
to
assist
you
with
all
expedition

My
Lord
Grey
hath
now
again
failed
me
of
the
rendezvous
at
Stamford
notwithstanding
that
both
he
and
I
received
Letters
from
his
Excellency
commanding
us
both
to
meet
and
together
with
Sir
John
Gell
and
the
Nottingham
forces
to
join
with
you

My
Lord
Grey
sent
Sir
Edward
Hartop
to
me
to
let
me
know
he
could
not
meet
me
at
Stamford
according
to
our
agreement
fearing
the
exposing
of
Leicester
to
the
forces
of
Mr.
Hastings
and
some
other
Troops
drawing
the
way

Believe
it
it
were
better
in
my
poor
opinion
Leicester
were
not
than
that
there
should
not
be
found
an
immediate
taking
of
the
field
by
our
forces
to
accomplish
the
common
ends

Wherein
I
shall
deal
as
freely
with
him
when
I
meet
him
as
you
can
desire

I
perceive
Ashby-de-la-Zouch
sticks
much
with
him

And
then
you
shall
receive
full
satisfaction
concerning
my
integrity
and
if
no
man
shall
help
you
yet
will
not
I
be
wanting
to
do
my
duty
God
assisting
me

If
we
could
unite
those
forces
'of
theirs;'
and
with
them
speedily
make
Grantham
the
general
rendezvous
both
of
yours
and
ours
I
think
it
would
do
well

I
shall
bend
my
endeavours
that
way

Your
concurrence
by
some
able
instrument
to
solicit
this
might
probably
exceedingly
hasten
it
especially
having
so
good
a
foundation
to
work
upon
as
my
Lord
General's
commands

Our
Norfolk
forces
which
will
not
prove
so
many
as
you
may
imagine
by
six
or
seven
hundred
men
will
lie
conveniently
at
Spalding
and
I
am
confident
be
ready
to
meet
at
Grantham
at
the
general
rendezvous

I
have
no
more
to
trouble
you

begging
of
God
to
take
away
the
impediments
that
hinder
our
conjunction


For
my
Noble
Friends
the
Committee
for
the
Isle
of
Ely
Present
these

I
have
given
order
to
Captain
Husband
to
see
them
recommitted
to
the
hands
of
my
Marshal
Richard
White

And
I
much
desire
you
for
the
future
not
to
entrench
upon
me
so
much
as
to
release
them
or
any
committed
in
the
like
case
by
myself
or
my
Deputy
and
Commanders
in
the
Garrison
-
until
myself
or
some
Superior
Authority
be
satisfied
in
the
cause
and
do
give
order
in
allowance
of
their
enlargement

For
I
profess
I
will
be
no
Goveror
nor
engage
any
other
under
me
to
undertake
such
a
charge
upon
such
I
am
so
sensible
of
the
need
we
have
to
improve
the
present
opportunity
of
our
being
masters
of
the
field
and
having
no
Enemy
near
the
Isle
and
to
spare
whatever
charge
we
can
towards
the
making
of
those
Fortifications
which
may
render
it
more
defensible
hereafter
if
we
shall
have
more
need
I
shall
desire
you
for
that
end
to
ease
the
Isle
and
Treasury
from
the
superfluous
charge
of
'having'
Two
several
Committees
for
the
several
parts
of
the
Isle
and
that
one
Committee
settled
at
March
may
serve
for
the
whole
Isle

Wherefore
I
wish

The

I
cannot

a

of

since
you
Layd

really
thanke

My

Bachelaur-shippe

height

a

I
am
sure
ought
to
speake
him
Indefective
in
any

Our
second
yeere
of
sophistry
is
always
taken
up
in
physicall
contemplation
(
without
perfect
knowledge
whereof
no
cleere
passage
is
granted
to
any

I

no

an

whereof
is
not
remanent
in

shall
(
submitting
to
your
maturer
judgment
review
the
whole

of
Philosophy
especially
Naturall

The
pleasantnesse
of
which
science
(
had
not

might
have
reinvited

have
seene
Cambridge
a

But
some
intervening
accidents
still
quas'd
my
jorney
And
now
you
know
that
supernaturall
cause
wch
prolongs
my

here

I
hope
the
heavynesse
of
that

will
shortly
be
removed
&
our

repupilld

then

god

I

you

The

high
&
noble
a
piece
of
chymistry
viz
the
re-individualling
of
an
incinerated

invites
mee
once
more
to
request
an
experimentall
eviction
of
it
from
your

and
I
hope
you
will
not
chide
my
Importunity

at

knockings
at

to
obtaine
a

of
so
great

admirable
a
mystery

'Tis
not
only
an
ocular
demonstration
of
our
resurrection
but
a
notable
illustration
of
that
Psychopannchy
wch
Antiquity
so
generally
received
how
these
Formes
of

may
be
lulled

wch

The
secret
is
so
noble
and
admirable
that
it
has
envited
my
enquiry's
into
divers
Authors
and
chymicall
Tractates
amongst
wch
Quercitan
and
Angelus
Salae
give
some
little
hint
thereof
but
so
obscurely
and
imperfectly
that
I
have
no
more
hopes
to
be
ocularly
convinced
through
their
pr‘scriptions
then
to
be
experimentally
confirm'd
that
the
species
of
an
incinerated
Animal
may
be
encask'd
in
a
piece
of
winter
chrystall

some
other
mineralists
confidently
affirme

Alsted
I
confesse
in
his
Pyrotechnia
more
cleerely
describes
the
matter
but
the
manner
of
experimenting
it
hee
utterly
leaves
unmentioned

Therefore
my
only
addresse
is
to
you
hoping
to
find
as
much
willingnesse
to
cmmunicate
as

this

I

returne
you
Infinite
thankes
for
your
excessive
paynes
in
doubling
of
yr
last
letter
to
mee
both
pages
whereof
were
so
exceeding
satisfactory
to
my
requests
as
that
I
know
not
wheather
of
them
may
more
justly
challenge
a
larger
returne
of
thankes
from
mee

for
the
fore-page
I
have
traced
yr

both
Gerard

Johnson's
addition
and
Parkinson
the

the
cleerer
cutt
and
outvies
the
other
in
an
accurate
description
of
a

the
latter
is
the
better
methodist
&
has
bedded
his
Plants
in
a
better
ranke
&
order

I
compared
also
Dodonæus
with
them
who
does
very
well
for
a
short
&
curt
Herbarist
yet
I
shall
embrace
Gerard
above
all
because
you
pleased
to
honour
him
with
your
approbation

For
the
backside
of
yr
letter
I
am
extreamely
satisfied
in
yr
resolves
of
my
Qu‘re

I
confesse
I
run
into
too
deepe
a
beliefe
&
too
strong
a
conceipt
of
chymistry
(
yet
not
beyond
wt
some
of
those
Artists

of
the
reproduction
of
the

plant
by
ordinary
way

the

thereof

sprout
out

But
it
will
bee
satisfaction
enough
to
the
greatest
of
my

the
leafes
thereof
shaddowed
in

experiment
I
hope
shall
have
the
happynesse
to

ocularly
evinced
at
some
opportunity
by
you

But
I
shall
determine
of
nothing

I
see
you

I
could

I

piece

she
refused

she
had

I
was
come
from
Anwerp
and
Bruxells

I
finde
you
haue
my
riddle
verie
right

I
saw
the
Queene
of
Sueden
at
the
play
she
is
extrauagant
in
her
fashion
and
aparell
but
she
has
a
good
well
fauoured
face
and
a
milde
countenance

One
of
the
players
that
knew
me
tolde
her
who
I
was
but
she
made
no
shew
of
it

I
went
the
next
day
to
Bruxelles
where
I
saw
the
Arch-duc
at
mass
and
I
saw
his
pictures
and
lodgins

Yett
she
sent
Donoy
to
me
with
a
verie
civill
message
that
she
was
sorie
she
coulde
not
use
that
ciuilitie
to
me
as
she
both
should
doe
and
desired
hoping
that
one
day
wee
might
meet
together
with
more
freedome
I
answered
her
as
civillie
as
I
coulde
and
now
when
I
went
from
Berghen
I
gaue
S=r=

Swann
charge
to
make
her
a

from

I
came
hither
vpon
Tewsday
from
Berghen
where
I
was
extremelie
well
intertained
by
the
Princess
of
Zolern
who
was
with
me
and
was
my
guide
all
the
iourney
and
defrayed
me

her
daughter
is
now
so
prettie
euerie

that
you
would
like
her
yet
better
than
euer
you
did
if
you
saw
her
she
is
much
growen
and
is
still
of
a
verie
sweet
disposition
and
she
doth
become
her
she
has
a
great
deal
of
witt
and
loues

be

either

easily

much
less

I
desire
you
in

matter

True
it
is
that
two

divers
Ministers
of
Newcastle
the
Bishoprick

an
honest
and
Christian
purpose
the
sum
whereof
I
extracted
and
returned
an
answer
thereunto
a
true
Copy
whereof
I
send
you
here
enclosed

By
which
I
think
it
will
easily
appear
that
the
consideration
of
my
kindness
is
well
deserved
by
them
provided
they
observe
the
condition
`there'
expressed
which
in
charity
I
am
bound
to
believe
they
will

their

will
know
how
to
judge
of
them

Having
said
this
I
or
rather
the
Lord
require
of
you
that
you
walk
in
all
peaceableness
and
gentleness
inoffensiveness
truth
and
love
towards
them
as
becomes
the
Servants

Jesus

Who

Himself

'To
his
Eminency
Cardinal
Mazarin.'
'Whitehall,'
26th
December
1656

The
obligations
and
many
instances
of
affection
which
I
have
received
from
your
eminency
do
engage
me
to
make
returns
suitable
to
your
merits

But
although
I
have
this
set
home
upon
my
spirit
I
may
not
(
shall
I
tell
you
I
cannot

at
this
juncture
of
time
and
as
the
face
of
my
affairs
now
stands
answer
to
your
call
for
Toleration

I
say
I
cannot
as
to
a
public
declaration
of
my
sense
in
that
point
although
I
believe
that
under
my
government
your
eminency
in
the
behalf
of
catholics
has
less
reason
for
complaint
as
to
rigour
upon
men's
consciences
than
under
the
parliament

For
I
have
of
some
and
those
very
many
had
compassion
making
a
difference

Truly
I
have
(
and
I
may
speak
it
with
cheerfulness
in
the
presence
of
god
who
is
a
witness
within
me
to
the
truth
of
what
I
affirm
made
a
difference
and
as
Jude
speaks
"
plucked
many
out
of
the
fire
the
raging
fire
of
persecution
which
did
tyrannise
over
their
consciences
and
encroached
by
an
arbitrariness
of
power
upon
their
estates

I
must
confess
that
I
had
some
doubts
of
its
success
till
providence
cleared
them
to
me
by
the
effects

I
was
truly
and
to
speak
ingenuously
not
without
doubtings
and
shall
not
be
ashamed
to
give
your
eminency
the
grounds
I
had
for
much
doubting

I
did
fear
that
Berkley
would
not
have
been
able
to
go
through
and
carry
on
that
work
and
that
either
the
Duke
would
have
cooled
in
his
suit
or
condescended
to
his
Brother

I
doubted
also
that
those
Instructions
which
I
sent
over
with
290
were
not
clear
enough
as
to
expressions
some
affairs
here
denying
me
leisure
at
that
time
to
be
so
particular
as
in
regard
to
some
circumstances
I
would

If
I
am
not
mistaken
in
the
Duke's
character
as
I
received
it
from
your
Eminency
that
fire
which
is
kindled
between
them
will
not
ask
bellows
to
blow
it
and
keep
it
burning

But
what
I
think
farther
necessary
in
this
matter
I
will
send
to
your
Eminency
by
Lockhart

and
now
I
shall
boast
to
your
Eminency
my
security
upon
a
well-builded
confidence
in
the
Lord
for
I
distrust
not
but
if
this
breach
be
widened
a
little
more
and
this
difference
fomented
with
a
little
caution
in
respect
of
the
persons
to
be
added
to
it
I
distrust
not
but
that
Party
which
is
already
forsaken
of
God
as
to
an
outward
dispensation
of
mercies
and
noisome
to
their
countrymen
will
grow
lower
in
the
opinion
of
all
the
world

If
I
have
troubled
your
Eminency
too
long
in
this
you
may
impute
it
to
the
resentment
of
joy
which
I
have
for
the
issue
of
this
Affair
and
`I'
will
conclude
with
giving
you
assurance
that
I
will
never
be
backward
in
demonstrating
as
becomes
your
brother
and
confederate
that
I
am
Your
servant
Oliver
P

And
that
which
increaseth
our
sense
`of
this'
is
The
resolution
we
`for
our
part'
had
rather
to
overdo
than
to
be
behindhand
in
anything
of
our
Treaty

And
although
we
never
were
so
foolish
`as'
to
apprehend
that
the
French
and
their
interests
were
the
same
with
ours
in
all
things
yet
as
to
the
Spaniard
who
hath
been
known
in
all
ages
to
be
the
most
implacable
enemy
that
France
hath
we
never
could
doubt
before
we
made
our
Treaty
that
going
upon
such
grounds
we
should
have
been
failed
`towards'
as
we
are

To
talk
of
`giving
us
Garrisons'
which
are
inland
as
Caution
for
future
action
to
talk
of
`what
will
be
done
next
Campaign,'
are
but
parcels
of
words
for
children

If
they
will
give
us
Garrisons
let
them
give
us
Calais
Dieppe
and
Boulogne
which
I
think
they
will
do
as
soon
as
be
honest
in
their
words
in
giving
us
any
one
Spanish
Garrison
upon
the
coast
into
our
hands

I
positively
think
which
I
say
to
you
they
are
afraid
we
should
have
any
footing
on
that
side
`of
the
Water,'
though
spanish

I
pray
you
tell
the
Cardinal
from
me
That
I
think
if
France
desires
to
maintain
its
ground
much
more
to
get
ground
upon
the
Spaniard
the
performance
of
his
Treaty
with
us
will
better
do
it
than
anything
appears
we
cannot
so
well
pretend
to
soldiery
as
those
that
are
with
him
yet
we
think
that
we
being
able
by
sea
to
strengthen
and
secure
his
Siege
and
`to'
reinforce
it
as
we
please
by
sea
and
the
Enemy
`being'
in
capacity
to
do
nothing
to
relieve
it
the
best
time
to
besiege
that
Place
will
be
now

Especially
if
we
consider
that
the
French
horse
will
be
able
so
to
ruin
Flanders
as
that
no
succour
can
be
brought
to
relieve
the
place
and
that
the
French
Army
and
our
own
will
have
constant
relief
as
far
as
England
and
France
especially
considering
the
Dutch
are
now
engaged
so
much
to
Southward
as
they
are

I
desire
you
to
let
him
know
That
Englishmen
have
had
so
good
experience
of
Winter
expeditions
they
are
confident
if
the
Spaniard
shall
keep
the
field
As
he
cannot
impede
this
work
so
neither
will
he
be
able
to
attack
anything
towards
France
with
a
possibility
of
retreat

I
desire
we
may
know
what
France
saith
and
will
do
upon
this
point

We
shall
be
ready
still
as
the
Lord
shall
asssist
us
to
perform
what
can
be
reasonably
expected
on
our
part

And
you
may
also
let
the
Cardinal
know
father
That
our
intentions
as
they
have
been
will
be
to
do
all
the
good
offices
we
can
to
promote
the
Interest
common
to
us

Apprehending
it
is
of
moment
that
this
Business
should
come
to
you
with
speed
and
surety
we

assistance
yet
I
had
rather
expose
mine
own
defects
to
your
good
interpretation
then
excuse
thereby
a
totall
neglect
of
my
duty
and
that
trust
which
is
divided
upon
me

At
my
late
absence
out
of
Town
I
had
taken
such
order
that
if
you
had
commanded
me
any
thing
I
might
soon
have
received
it
and
so
returned
on
purpose
to
this
place
to
have
obeyed
you

There
is
yet
brought
in
an
Act
in
which
of
all
others
your
corporation
is
the
least
concerned
that
is
where
wives
shall
refuse
to
cohabit
with
their
husbands
that
in
such
case
the
husband
shall
not
be
liable
to
pay
any
debts
which
she
shall
run
into
for
clothing
diet
lodging
or
other
expenses

I
wish
with
all
my
heart
you
were
no
more
touched
in
a
vote
that
we
have
made
for
bringing
in
an
Act
of
a
new
Assessment
for
six
moneths
of
70000
=li=
per
mensem
to
begin
next
January

The
truth
is
the
delay
ere
monyes
can
be
got
in
eats
up
a
great
part
of
all
that
is
levying
and
that
growing
charge
of
the
Army
and
Navy
doubles
upon
us

And
that
is
all
that
can
be
said
for
excuse
of
our selves
to
the
Country
to
whom
we
had
giuen
our
own
hopes
of
no
further
Sessment
to
be
raised
but
must
now
needs
incurre
the
censure
of
improvidence
before
or
prodigality
now
though
it
becomes
no
private
member
the
resolution
having
passed
the
house
to
interpose
further
his
own
judgement
in
a
thing
that
can
not
be
remedied
and
it
will
be
each
mans
ingenuity
not
to
grudge
an
after-payment
for
that
settlement
and
freedome
from
Armyes
&
Navyes
w=ch=
before
he
would
have
been
glad
to
purchase
with
his
whole
fortune

There
remain
some
eight
Regiments
to
be
disbanded
but
those
all
horse
in
a
manner
and
some
seauenteen
shipps
to
be
payd
of
that
have
laid
so
long
upon
charge
in
the
harbour
beside
fourscore
shipps
w=ch=
are
reckoned
to
us
for
this
winter
guard
But
after
that
all
things
are
to
go
upon
his
Majestyes
own
purse
out
of
the
Tunnage
&
Poundage
&
his
other
revenues

But
there
being
so
great
a
provision
made
for
mony
I
doubt
not
but
ere
we
rise
to
see
the
whole
army
disbanded
and
according
to
the
Act
hope
to
see
your
Town
once
more
ungarrisond
in
w=ch=
I
should
be
glad
and
happy
to
be
instrumentall
to
the
uttermost
For
I
can
not
but
remember
though
then
a
child
those
blessed
days
when
the
youth
of
your
own
town
were
trained
for
your
militia
and
did
methought
become
their
arms
much
better
then
any
soldiers
that
I
have
seen
there
since

And
it
will
not
be
amisse
if
you
please
(
now
that
we
are
about
a
new
Act
of
regulating
the
Militia
that
it
may
be
as
a
standing
strength
but
not
as
ill
as
a
perpetuall
Army
to
the
Nation
to
signify
to
me
any
thing
in
that
matter
that
were
according
to
your
ancient
custome
&
desirable
for
you

For
though
I
can
promise
litle
yet
I
intend
all
things
for
your
service

The
purchasers
the
other
day
offerd
the
house
600000
=li=
in
ready
mony
&
to
make
the
Bishops
&c
revenue
as
good
or
better
then
before

But
the
House
thought
it
not
fit
or
seasonable
to
hearken
to
it

We
are
so
much
the
more
concernd
to
see
that
great
interest
of
the
purchasers
satisfyed
&
quieted
at
least
in
that
way
which
our
own
votes
have
propounded

On
Munday
next
we
are
to
return
to
the
consideration
of
apportioning
100000
=li=
p
ann~
upon
all
the
lands
in
the
nation
in
lieu
of
the
Court
of
Wards

The
debate
among
the
Countyes
each
thinking
it
selfe
over-rated
makes
the
successe
of
that
businesse
somthing
casuall
&
truly
I
shall
not
assist
it
much
for
my
part
for
it
is
litle
reason
that
your
Town
should
contribute
in
that
charge

The
Excise
bill
for
longer
continuance
(
I
wish
it
prove
not
too
long
will
come
in
also
next
weeke
And
I
foresee
we
shall
be
called
upon
shortly
to
effect
our
vote
made
the
former
sitting
of
raising
his
Majesties
revenue
to
1200000
=li=
per
Annum
I
do
not
love
to
write
so
much
of
this
mony
news
But
I
thinke
you
have
observed
that
Parliaments
have
been
always
made
use
of
to
that
purpose
and
though
we
may
buy
gold
too
deare
yet
we
must
at
any
rate
be
glad
of
Peace
Freedome
&
a
good
Conscience

M=r=
Maior
tells
me
your
duplicates
of
the
Poll
are
coming
up
I
shall
go
with
them
to
the
Exchequer
&
make
your
excuse
if
any
be
requisite

My
long
silence
hath
made
me
now
trespasse
on
the
other
hand
in
a
long
letter
but
I
doubt
not
of
your
good
construction
of
so
much
familiarity
and
trouble
from
Gentlemen
Your
most
affectionate
friend
&
servant
Andr
Marvell

I
received
to day
another
letter
of
yours
of
the
17=th=
directed
to
my
selfe
&
M=r=
Ramsden
who
is
not
yet
arrived
in
M=r=
Wilsons
businesse

He
hath
been
with
me
&
seems
to
build
much
upon
my
advise

I
counselled
him
before
I
had
yours
in
any
case
not
to
thinke
any
more
of
Hezle
but
if
he
could
(
as
he
said
he
had
some
hopes
to
make
for
Leeds
upon
M=r=
Stiles
his
acceptance
of
Hezle

I
shall
be
very
tender
and
sensible
of
your
interest
herein
&
shall
afford
him
no
assistance
but
on
the
contrary
in
any thing
reflecting
upon
your
proceedings

But
as
farre
as
I
can
understand
him
and
I
shall
now
be
the
more
watchfull
over
him
he
hath
wholy
laid
by
any
such
thoughts
&
his
whole
designe
is
now
upon
Leeds

Yesterday
after
a
long
debate
upon
the
compensation
for
the
Court
of
Wards
twas
resolued
that
for
the
Tenures
of
Lands
in
Capite
knights
Service
Court
of
Wards
and
all
the
emoluments
thereof
and
for
taking
away
of
Purveyance
the
king
should
have
in
perpetuity
one
moity
of
the
Excise
of
Beere
and
Ale

The
other
Moity
was
not
then
disposed
of
but
'tis
likely
will
come
in
into
the
yearly
revenue
of
1200000
=li=
which
must
be
setled

to day
we
were

Gentlemen
since
my
last
to
you
the
House
hath
been
for
the
most
part
busied
in
carrying
on

maturing
those
bills
w=ch=
I
formerly
signified
to

to
be

one
moity
of

And
the
Bill
upon
reading
the
amendments
was
ordered
to
be
ingrossed

After
that
the
House
fell
upon
the
making
out
of
the
Kings
revenue
to
1200000
=li=
a
yeare
&
have
voted
that
the

Ale
shall
be
giuen
to
his

life
to
make
up
the
full
of
the
said
1200000

herein
in

it

Gentlemen
Since
our
last
we
haue
deliuered
yours
to
my
Lord
Bellasis
who
is
always
very
kind
&
ready
to
further
you
in
any thing

He
saith
Mr.
Hebird
hath
been
with
him
&
that
he
gaue
him
advice
till
Mr.
Stiles
should
be
able
to
come
to
Hull
that
he
should
continue
there
&
promised
him
that
he
will
contribute
what
he
can
towards
his
abiding
with
you

So
that
if
he
faile
in
his
businesse
it
must
haue
been
by
his
own
ill
management

We
conceive
it
might
be
fitting
for
you
now
to
be
sending
some
answer
in
Mr.
Hilyards
busines
whch
he
is
very
sollicitous
about

If
it
be
negative
your
own
judgments
will
easily
perfect
it
better
out
of
that
matter
couched
in
our
former
letter

If
otherwise
it
is
much
easyer

The
house
hath
sent
up
to
the
Lords
the
bill
for
review
of
the
Poll
&
the
two
bills
for
the
two
moitys
of
the
Excise

But
that
for
forain
&
inland
commoditys
is
not
yet
out
of
doubt
with
us

That
for
6
months
assess
is
wellnigh
finishd

And
we
haue
given
his
Majesty
yet
one
months
Sesse
more
to
buy
jewells
for
his
Crown
&
a
Jewell
of
1000

to
Col
Windam
who
was
very
instrumentall
in
his
M=tys=
escape

Major
White
was
a
principall
in
it
&
reveals
others

Col
Overton
&
divers
others
are
apprehended
hereupon
&
put
in
the
Towr

We
haue
not
further
but
to
remaine

most
affectionate

Gentlemen
Our
businesse
in
Parliament
not
being
yet
completed
his
Majesty
hath
deferred
to
dissolve
us
till
Saturday
next
&
we
expect
that
day
may
hold

For
this
day
and
to morrow
we
haue
adjourned

The
other
Bill
giuing
the
other
moity
to
his
Majesty
for
life
towards
the
making
up
of
his
whole

The
Bills
for
Wine
Licences

For
the
Post
For
review
of

Poll
For
6
moneths
Sesment
For
one

expense
of
coronation
For
arrears
of
twelve
&
three
moneths
Assesm=t=
For
Arrears
of
Excise
are
all
ready
but
not
yet
passd

The
Excise
of
forrain
&
inland
commodityes
'tis
hoped
may
now
fall
to
the
ground

Yet
before
we
rise
it
will
undergo
a
very
stiffe
debate
on
both
sides
by
reason
of
some
publick
debts
formerly
secured
&
others
desired
to
be
added
there
upon

The
jealousy
is
least
this
Excise
should
also
be
perpetuated
For
there
will
neuer
want
publick
debts
to
be
ingrafted
upon
it

There
hath
been
a
motion
and
likely
to
be
renewd
in
the
House
for
an
Act
to
impowre
Commissioners
to
receive
the
voluntary
benevolence
of
all
persons
through
the
Country
towards
his
M=tyes=
coronation

But
we
hope
it
will
not
take

The
Princesse
of
Orange
dy'de
yesterday
at
his
M=tyes=
return
from
the
Lords
house
having
bin
some
fiue
days
sick
of

M=r=
Hebird
hath
not
in
all
this
while
seen
either
of
us
so
that
we
are
at
a
losse
in
his
business
&
can
only
contribute
our
good
wishes
towards
it

To
Mayor
Richardson

Worthy
Sir
The
businesse
of
the
House
hath
not
been
of
very
publick
consequence
yesterday
being
taken
up
by
a
Petition
preferrd
by
one
M=r=
Liddall
that
the
House
would
giue
him
leave
to
prosecute
at
law
S=r=
John
Morly
a
member
of
the
House
for
Newcastle
upon
a
charge
of
high
Treason
for
some
correspondence
he
had
held
with
Oliuer
Cromwell
&
mony
w=ch=
he
had
in
earnest
thereof
received
of
S=r=
George
Downing
when
resident
in
Holland

For
the
kings
meniall
servants
or
those
w=ch=
acted
by
instructions
from
the
king
betraying
their
trust
are
excepted
out
of
the
Act
of
Indemnity

The
House
left
Liddall
to
prosecute
him
at
law

The
Committee
for
Confirming
the
Acts
of
the
last
Parlament
sat
yesterday
also
&
are
carrying
l
c
on
that
businesse
but
indeed
the
Bill
then
passd
for
confirmation
of
Ministers
will
I
doubt
undergoe
a
very
hard
scrutiny
so
that
I
think
as
I
intimated
to
you
in
my
last
whosoever
have
the
businesse
of
their
ministers
in
a
present
tolerable
and
secure
posture
had
best
make
much
of
that
and
not
expose
themselves
to
a
further
hazard

I
belieue
in
this
conjuncture
I
shall
be
left
single
in
attempting
any
thing
for
your
patronage
notwithstanding
the
assistance
you
expected
from
some
others

For
so
they
signify
to
me

And
I
doubt
you
will
hardly
agree
about
the
levying
of
your
ministers
maintenance

But
in
this
thing
according
as
I
write
to
you
you
must
please
to
be
very
reserved
&
rest
very
much
upon
your
own
prudence

I
would
not
haue
you
suspect
any
misintelligence
betwixt
my
partner
&
me
because
we
write
not
to
you
joyntly
as
M=r=
Ramsden
&
I
used

For
there
is
all
civility
betwixt
us

But
it
was
his
sense
that
we
should
each
be
left
to
his
own
discretion
for
writing
except
upon
some
answer
unto
your
Letters
&
that
to
be
joyntly

Gentlemen
our
very
worthy
friends
We
would
not
let
the
first
letter
w=ch=
we
haue
had
the
honour
to
receiue
from
you
(
of
the
14
May
ly
by
us
without
returne
till
the
next
Post
chusing
rather
to
be
something
imperfect
then
wholy
defective
in
answering
you
about
your
businesse
&
rendring
our
own
due
respects
&
civilityes
to
you

We
are
willingly
quickened
by
you
for
the
Act
of
Separation
of
your
Church
from
Hessel
&
thank
you
for
what
you
contribute
towards
it
in
the
papers
you
inclosed

Whereby
there
seems
to
us
litle
to
be
wanting
towards
the
expedition
of
that
Bill
w=ch=
is
in
good
forwardnesse
to
be
presented
to
the
House
but
that
you
be
pleased
to
deale
with
all
those
in
your
towne
who
shall
by
this
Act
be
made
contributory
to
such
maintenance
for
your
Minister
for
their
general
&
particular
consent
towards
it
by
their
subscribing
to
a
paper
testifying
their
assent

For
the
Parlament
is
always
very
nice
&
curious
in
this
point
of
involving
men
in
any
sesse
or
contribution
of
this
nature
without
their
voluntary
&
expresse
concurrence

That
Patent
of
ballast
is
grievous
alike
to
all
the
ports
&
if
we
can
pitch
upon
some
common
way
to
seek
redresse
with
that
modesty
w=ch=
is
expedient
where
his
Mt=yes=
seale
is
in
the
case
we
shall
incite
and
joyn
with
those
that
haue
the
same
interest

As
to
your
Patent
for
the
gaging
of
wines
&
your
former
power
to
grant
foure
wine
licences
it
shall
be
our
care
betwixt
this
&
our
next
letter
to
giue
you
a
good
account
and
do
you
the
best
service
therein
as
in
all
other
matters
recommended
by
you
or
occurring
to
us

The
newest
matters
here
are
the
ingrossing
of
the
Act
for
safety
of
the
kings
person

The
bill
for
the
Militia
read
once

A
bill
for
inabling
Church-wardens
to
rate
such
monys
as
are
necessary
for
the
repaire
of
the
Churches
&c
and
an
order
sent
to
the
Lords
for
their
concurrence
for
burning
the
Covenant
by
the
Common
Hangman
&
taking
it
down
in
all
churches
which
though
not
unanimous
yet
was
carried
by
228
voices
against
103

We
are
as
much
straitned
in
paper
and
time
at
present
as
we
shall
be
always
inlarged
in
affection

We
see
among
the
rest
of
your
papers
that
declaration
of
M=r=
Raiks
his
(
before
he
had
got
Hessell
toward
the
separation

Tis
as
necessary
that
(
now

is
possessd
of
Hessell

do
some
new
writing

Gentlemen
In
addition
to
what
we
writ
you
last
you
may
please
to
take
notice
that
whereas
in
your
letter
to
us
you
say
a
summe
not
exceeding
250
=li=
per
annum
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
you
ascertain
in
expresse
words
the
summe
that
is
to
be
raised
by
pound
rent
without
leaving
it
so
farre
indefinite

But
if
you
had
once
got
the
consent
and
subscription
of
all
those
particular
persons
who
are
to
contribute
after
the
separation
to
the
maintenance
of
your
ministers
(
w=ch=
can
not
neither
properly
be
had
but
to
a
certain
summe
you
should
then
find
for
the
rest
that
your
bill
should
have
as
quick
a
dispatch
as
you
or
we
can
desire

In
that
matter
of
ballast
we
have
spoke
with
the
members
of
severall
ports
who
are
sensible
of
that
grieuance
&
we
are
deliberating
how
to
proceed
therein
either
by
petition
to
his
M=ty=
for
reversing
the
Patent
or
else
by
a
short
act
for
that
end

As
for
the
Patent
for
gaging
of
wines
we
think
the
sooner
you
send
up
your
charter
for
that
from
king
James
that
it
may
be
renewed
the
better
you
will
do
&
then
will
be
the
most
naturall
time
to
take
notice
of
that
of
Palmers

For
your
foure
wine
licences
by
statute
of
Edward
the
6=th=
we
haue
appointed
a
meeting
with
M=r=
Recorder
before
the
next
Post
&
according
as
we
shall
upon
the
discussing
of
it
find
you
more
or
lesse
concerned
we
shall
in
the
bill
for
confirmation
of
publick
Acts
wherein
also
is
that
for
wine
licences
interpose
for
the
preservation
of
your
interest
therein

We
remaine

If

I

Farewell
my
deare
Friend

MY
DEAR
FRIEND
-
I
am
extremely
troubled
to
find
by
yours
of
the
2oth
that
I
am
not
to
expect
the
satisfaction
of
your
company
for
a
long
continuance
till
after
your
sister
is
up
again
and
though
I
owne
I
am
very
covetious
of
it
sooner
yett
I
will
not
be
so
foolishly
fond
of
it
as
to
presse
you
to
for
so
very
short
a
time
pray
send
me
word
if
you
thinke
it
impossible
for
your
sister
to
be
persuaded
to
dispense
with
your
absence
while
she
lays
for
if
she
would
be
soe
selfe
denying
and
so
very
obliging
to
me
that
longs
of
all
things
in
the
world
to
see
you
I
should
acknolidg
it
the
greatest
generossety
for
her
imaginable
and
a
very
peculiar
honour
to
me
as
for
what
you
apprehend
of
Mrs
Scropes
power
with
me
to
your
prejudice
your
justification
on
that
poynt
is
very
unnecessary
for
I
assure
you
the
esteeme
&
kindnesse
I
have
for
you
is
much
above
the
civility
I
have
for
her
besides
I
have
so
genneral
a
justice
for
all
persons
as
never
to
condemn
any
with
out
indenyabIe
proufs
of
theare
guiltt
but
Mrs
Scrow
(
Scrope
is
so
little
a
person
in
my
opinion
and
so
sildom
in
my
thoughts
that
whoever
gave
her
that
information
I
forgive
them
though
I
doe
not
remember
I
told
anybody
of
the
kind
things
she
sayed
of
me
but
I
will
never
believe
it
was
you
when
you
have
thoughts
of
coming
to
Bredby
send
me
word
and
my
choch
shall
meet
you
at
Northampton
to
which
place

all
the
conveancey
you

you
can
come
heather
send
me
word
by
the

if

DEARE
MADAM
You
treat
me
in
your
letters
so
much
to
my
advantage
and
above
my
merit
that
I
am
almost
affray'd
to
tell
you
how
exceedingly
I
am
pleased
with
them
lesst
you
should
attribute
yt
contentment
to
ye
delight
I
take
in
being
praised
whereas
I
am
extreamely
deceived
if
that
be
ye
ground
of
it
though
I
confess
it
is
not
free
from
vanity

I
cannot
choose
but
be
proud
of
being
own'd
by
soe
valuable
a
person
as
you
are
and
one
whom
all
my
inclinations
carry
me
to
honour
and
love
at
a
very
great
rate
and
you
will
find
by
the
trouble
I
last
gave
you
of
this
kind
how
impossible
it
will
be
for
you
to
be
rid
of
an
importunity
which
you
have
much
encourag'd
and
how
much
your
late
silence
alarm'd
one
yt
is
so
much
concern'd
for
ye
honour
you
doe
her
in
allowing
her
to
hope
you
will
frequently
let
her
know
she
hath
some
room
in
yr
particular
favour
I
hope
you
have
pardon'd
me
that
complaint
and
allow'd
a
little
jealousy
to
the
great
passion
I
have
for
you
and
that
I
shall
with
some
more
assurance
come
to
thank
you
for
this
last
favour
of
12th
instant
and
must
beg
you
to
believe
that
if
my
convent
were
in
Cataya
and
I
a
recluse
by
vow
to
it
yet
I
should
never
attain
mortification
enough
to
be
able
willingly
to
deny
myself
the
great
entertainment
of
your
correspondance
which
seems
to
remove
me
out
of
a
solitary
religious
house
on
ye
mountains
and
place
me
in
the
most
advantageous
prospect
upon
both
court
and
town
and
give
me
right
to
a
better
place
than
of
either
and
that
madam
is
your
friendship
which
is
so
great
a
present
that
there
is
but
one
way
to
make
it
more
valuable
and
yt
is
by
making
it
less
ceremonious
and
by
using
me
with
a
freedom
that
may
give
me
more
access
into
your
heart
and
this
beg
from
you
with
a
great
earnestness
and
will
promise
you
that
whatsoever
liberties
of
that
kind
you
allow
me
yt
I
will
never
so
much
abase
that
goodness
as
to
press
mine
own
advantages
further
than
you
shall
permit
or
lessen
any
of
the
respect
I
ow
you
by
the
less
formal
approaches
I
desire
to
make
to
you
who
though
I
esteem
above
most
of
ye
world
yet
I
love
yet
more

I
believe
ere
this
you
have
seen
the
new
Pompey
either
acted
or
written
and
then
will
repeat
your
partiallity
to
ye
others
but
I
wonder
much
what
preparations
for
it
could
prejudice
Will
Davenant
when
I
hear
they
acted
in
English
habits
and
yt
so
a
propos
yt
Cesar
was
sent
in
with
a
feather
and
a
staff
till
he
was
hissed
off
ye
stage
and
for
ye
scenes
I
do
not
see
where
they
could
place
any
that
are
very
extraordinary
but
if
this
play
hath
not
diverted
the
Citizens
wives
enough
Sr.
W.
D.
will
make
them
amends
for
they
say
Harry
the
8th
and
some
later
ones
are
little
better
than
puppet
plays

I
understand
ye
confederate
translators
are
now
upon
Heraclins
and
I
am
contented
that
Sir
Thos.
Clarges
who
hath
done
that
last
year
should
adorn
this
triumph
in
it
as
I
have
done
in
Pompey
for
I
defy
Heraclius
and
all
his
works
having
so
unfortunately
piqu'd
Mr.
Waller
yt
he
was
pleased
to
speak
of
me
with
as
little
generosity
to
ye
King
as
he
once
did
of
Sacharissa
to
ye
Parliament
and
I
fear
his
displeasure
is
no
wit
abated
since
ye
King's
and
Queen's
so
gracious
reception
of
those
verses
you
mention
upon
her
majesties
recovery
and
though
this
advantageous
opinion
might
have
given
me
some
vanity
yet
Ile
assure
you
Madam
yours
gave
me
more
and
though
I
never
writt
anything
with
more
distrust
of
myself
yt
since
you
think
them
worthy
of
so
favourable
a
mention
I
will
submit
my
judgement
to
you
and
rather
think
it
possible
that
I
might
hit
something
in
them
not
unluckily
then
that
you
could
be
unsincere
to
one
you
are
pleased
so
generously
to
own

You
see
how
much
I
depend
upon
what
you
say
and
therefore
you
ought
in
honour
never
to
use
me
with
compliment

I
am
glad
of
the
news
of
ye
Duchesses
recovery
and
the
other
victory
you
mention
at
Court
for
though
it
be
but
changing
our
pack
of
cards
for
another
yet
time
and
inconstancy
together
may
at
last
fix
yt
passion
where
it
ought
to
be

I
think
the
conquered
rivall
has
done
well
in
the
change
of
her
principles
for
I
wonder
all
ladies
of
her
morality
are
not
of
a
religion
which
provides
them
soe
many
shorter
ways
to
heaven
than
repentance
and
when
at
the
wane
of
their
fortune
they
may
retire
into
a
Cloyster
and
persuade
ye
worlde
yt
the
shame
of
their
disgrace
is
only
ye
devotion
of
their
souls
and
soe
make
a
virtue
of
necessity

I
know
you
have
goodness
and
generosity
enough
to
doe
me
this
right
in
your
company
and
to
give
me
your
opinion
too
how
I
may
best
get
this
impression
suppressed
aud
myself
vindicated
and
therefore
I
will
not
beg
your
pardon
for
troubling
you
with
this
impertinent
story
nor
for
so
long
an
harangue
as
this
the
truth
is
I
would
fain
by
example
if
I
can
not
by
importunity
induce
you
to
yt
freedom
which
is
begged
of
you
as
soe
necessary
to
ye
happinesse
of
my
D
deare
Madam
Your
most
faithful
servant
ORINDA

To
Mr.
Temple
my
humble
service
I
beg

If
Madam
you
dislike
my
payment
of
two
letters
for
one
acuse
yourselfe
for
beginning
with
one
and
this
Towne
for
your
being
ill
entertained
for
if
that
would
punishe
me
I
would
write
it
at

all
I
could
get
brought
to
me
for

Your
sister
will
now
bee
satisfied
her
intelligence
was
true
concerning
my
Lady
Harvie
for
I
suppose
she
knowes
that
she
has
not
bine
at
Court
since
the
King's
seeing
that
she
tooke
to
herselfe
represented
affter
she
had
made
so
publicke
a
complaint
of
it
and
now
she
expects
some
favourable
expressions
from
his
Ma.=tie=
to
encourage
her
coming
againe
but
yet
that
is
not
obtained
though
it
has
bine
much
endeavoured
but
the
King
being
a
very
civill
person
and
she
having
a
mind
to
be
sattisfied
the
busynesse
will
probablye
be
don

Tis
a
dangerous
thinge
I
finde
for
Ladyes
to
brage
of
power
in
State
affaires
and
I
am
confident
it
has
caused
that
to
be
don
that
would
not
have
bine
to
any
other
gentlewoman

Her
brother
is
extremely
concerned
in
her
disgrace
wh.
has
bine
nowe
a
greate
while
to
satisfy
those
who
did
not
wishe
her
in
favour

I
believe
nobody
is
unwillinge
she
should
showe
herselfe
in
the
Drawingroome
the
Queene
has
taken
no
notice
of
this
businesse
except
very
privately

She
received
the
Portugall
envoy
very
coldly
that
brought
the
news
of
the
young
Princes
yet
she
says
now
the
Pope
has
confirmed
the
marriage
she
has
nothing
to
say

I
thinke
there
is
noe
Premier
Minister
here
nor
any
greate
favorite
those
who
have
had
most
have
soe

What
will
be
don
with
my
Ld.
of
Ormond
is
not
knowne
to
the
Vulgar
but
guess
he
will
goe
out
more
than
who
shall
come

The
Duchesse

as
well
as
is
possible

has
as
fine
a
childe

ever
was

I
should
with
greate
pleasure
send

newes
of
the
Queene's

her
condition

Mr.
Montague

presently
my
Ld.
Harry
Howard
will
goe
noe
further

Tangiers
till
he
knowes

will

well
My
Lady
Devonshire
was
used
wth
such
great
respect
that
day
she
cristened
the
Duke's
childe
that
it
will
make

sett
up
a
table
three
dayes
in
a
week
that
is

shall
be
very
constant

So
great
news
as
the
change
of
the
Lieutenant

Sunday
the
King
at
my
Lord
Keepers
dismissed
the
Duke
of
Ormond
from
it
with
many
gracious
expressions
that
it
was
not
for
any
fault
or
miscarriages
of
his
governing
on
any
declination
of
his
kindness
to
his
person
which
he
would
shew
by
taking
him
into
all
his
counsels
the
Duke
of
Ormond
made
a
long
speech
to
the
King
and
then
complimented
my
Ld.
Roberts
which
he
more
than
returned
soe
very
much
civility
past
since
he
attends
the
King
with
the
very
same
dilligence
he
did
before
with
as
much
submission
and
humility
as
is
possible
and
severetye
to
his

The
Duke
of
Buckingham
has
his
greatest
desire
in
his
being
out
but
not
all
tis
thought
because
he
did
not
choose
his
successor

A
Tuesday
the
King
dined
at
the
Dutch
Embassador's
they
will
all
treate
him
I
believe
and
none
worse
than
the
French
did
except
that
their
cooks
are
better
than
others
for
'twas
as
poore
as
could
be
on
such
an
occasion
and
the
man
stood
at
the
doore
taking
care
himselfe
of
his
plate
and
they
say
to
have
the
sweetnesses
saved
but

think
that
cannot

in
a
little
with
the
Duchess
of
Monmouth
again
soe
far
as
to
see
her
sometimes

She
has
the
courage
only
to
resolve
to
have
her
hip
set
but
not
to
suffer
it
to
be

when
she
goes
about
it
makes
litle
tryalls

then
begs

to
let
her
alone

This
has
been
a
very
quarrelsome
week
before
the
King
my
Ld.
of
Rochester
forgot
his
dutye
so
much
as
to
strike
Tome
Keeligrew
he
was
in
a
case
not
to
know
what
he
did
but
he
is
forbid
the
court
and
Brunkard
and
Sir
John
Morton
were
so
high
in
wordes
in
the
Queen's
Privye
chamber
that
they
were
both
committed
by
my
Ld.

My
Ld.
Burleigh
goes
a-woing
as
they
call
it
with
hopes
that
his
Father
and
my
Ld.
of
Devonshire
will
not
agree
he
can
endure
my
Lady
Rich
as
well
as
any
other
wife

he
had
rather
have
none

For
Mr.

21
May
1668

If
it
be
true
that
wee
are
generally
enclined
to
covett
what
wee
admire
I
can
assure
you
my
ambition
aspires
not
to
the
fame
of
Balzac
and
therefor
must
not
thank
you
for
entitling
me
to
that
great
name

I
do
not
admire
his
style
nor
emulate
the
spirit
of
discontent
which
runns
through
all
his
letters

There
is
a
lucky
hitt
in
reputation
which
some
obtaine
by
the
deffect
in
their
judges
rather
than
from
the
greatnesse
of
their
merit
the
contrary
may
be
instanced
in
Doctor
Donne
who
had
he
not
ben
really
a
learned
man
a
libertine
in
witt
and
a
courtier
might
have
been
allowed
to
write
well
but
I
confess
in
my
opinion
with
these
qualifications
be
falls
short
in
his
letters
of
the
praises
some
give
him

Voiture
seems
to
excell
both
in
quicknesse
of
fancy
easinesse
of
expression
&
in
a
facile
way
of
insinuating
that
he
was
not
ignorant
of
letters
an
advantage
the
Court
ayre
gives
persons
who
converse
with
the
world
as
books

I
wonder
at
nothing
more
than
at
the
ambition
of
printing
letters
since
if
the
design
be
to
produce
witt
and
learning
there
is
too
little
scope
for
the
one
and
the
other
may
be
reduced
to
a
lesse
compasse
than
a

up

can
signifie
very
little
to
any
besides
the
persons
they
are
addressed
to
and
therefore
must
loose
infinitely
by
being
exposed
to
the

haue
received
y=r=

but
none
of
those
you
mention
which
were

If
you
were
so
desirous
to
answer
our
expectations
as
you
pretend
to

you
would
give

comes
before

the

effect
in
y=r=

of
Sparta
when
their

were
presented
to
them
in
that
brutish
condition
not
only
from
the
deformity
of
auch
a

but
from
a
motive
beyond
theirs
the
hope
of

those
rigorous
heathens
in

You

too
young

that
lying
defrauding
swearing
disobedience
to

in

are
offences
to

Gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
Since
my
last
we
haue
returned
the
bill
of
Commissioners
to
treat
with
the
Scotch
to
the
Lords
which
will
undoubtedly
pass

We
have
sent
them
up
this
morning
the
bill
for
prohibition
of
all
forain
Brandy

w=ch=
though
it
goes
up
so
late
I
belieue
will
passe
before
our
rising

The
City
bill
has
been
sent
down
with
many
alterations
w=ch=
yet
we
haue
gone
thorough
&
agreed
to
except
in
one
point
w=ch=
they
will
certainly
concurre
in
and
may
be
reckond
as
past

The
Lords
haue
agreed
with
the
Bill
of
retrospect
upon
Brandy
to
pay
8=
d=
since
1666

The
Lords
haue
as
we
heare
thrown
out
that
part
of
our
bill
for
shipping
wherein
we
provided
against
men
of
warre
trading
in
merchandise

Truly
in
an
ill
season
when
so
many
merchants
complain
and
the
Turks
take
prizes
in
our
Chanell

Hereupon
the
house
being
disappointed
(
for
in
the
mean
while
he
was
escaped
by
the
back
doore
orderd
that
doore
to
be
naild
up
for
the
future
haue
revived
their
votes
of
63
against
all
paper
protections
against
protection
for
any
but
meniall
servants
&c
&
to
day
after
a
long
debate
for
expelling
him
the
house
haue
for
some
good
reasons
giuen
him
till
the
second
Tuesday
after
our
next
meeting
to
appear

When
that
will
be
is
not
yet
evident

Some
say
before
Midsummer
others
toward
Winter

But
however
I
hope
we
shall
rise
on
Munday
or
at
furthest
Tuesday

For
it
is
high
time
hauing
much
ado
to
get
forty
together
to
make
a
house
&
when
we
divided
about
the
Fee
farm
being
in
all
but

The
next
meeting
I
hope
will
be
better
attended

I

Gentlemen
Your
most
affectionate
serv=t=
Andr
Marvell
To
Mr.
Bohun

1671

I
should
not
question
y=rs=
in
other
thmgs
but
the
wisest
may
be
allow'd
some
grains
and
I
concludc
you
no
lesse
a
courtier
than
a
philosopher

Since
my
last
to
you
I
have
seene
"
The
Siege
of
Grenada
a
play
so
full
of
ideas
that
the
most
refined
romance
I
euer
read
is
not
to
compare
with
it
love
is
made
so
pure
and
valor
so
nice
that
one
would
imagine
it
designed
for
an
Vtopia
rather
then
our
stage

I
do
not
quarrell
with
the
poet
but
admire
one
borne
in
the
decline
of
morality
should
be
able
to
feigne
such
exact
virtue
and
as
poetic
fiction
has
been
instructive
in
former
ages
I
wish
this
the
same
event
in
ours

As
to
the
strict
law
of
Comedy
I
dare
not
pretend
to
judge
some
thinke
the
division
of
the
story
not
as
well
as
if
it
could
all
haue
ben
comprehended
in
the
dayes
actions
truth
of
history
exactness
of
time
possibilities
of
adventures
are
niceties
the
antient

criticks
might
require
but
tbose
who
havc
outdone
them
in
fine
notions
may
be
allowed
the
liberty
to
expresse
them
their
owne
way
and
the
present
world
is
so
enlightened
that
the
old
dramatique
must
bear
no
sway

This
account
perhaps
is
not
enough
to
do
Mr.
Driden
right
yet
is
as
much
as
you
can
expect
from
the
leisure
of
one
who
has
the
care
of
a
nursery

To
Mr.
Bohun
Fellow
of
New
College
Oxford

wee
may
not
reproch
our
owne
since
heere
is
at
this
present
a
scene
for
galantrie
and
merit
and
whilst
wee
may
hope
wee
must
not
condemne

Should
I
tell
you
how
full
of
sorrow
I
have
ben
for
the
losse
of
Dr.
Bretton
you
only
would
blame
me
after
death
flattery
ceases
therefore
you
may
beleeve
there
was
some
cause
to
lament
when
thousands
of
weeping
eyes
witnessed
the
affliction
their
soule
were
in
one
would
have
imagined
every
one
in
this
parish
had
lost
a
father
brother
or
husband
so
great
was
the
bewailing
and
in
earnest
it
dos
appeare
there
never
was
a
better
nor
a
more
worthy
man

Such
was
his
temper
prudence
charity
and
good
conduct
that
he
gained
the
weake
and
preserved
the
wise

The
sudenesse
of
his
death
was
a
surprise
only
to
his
friends
as
for
himselfe
it
might
be
looked
upon
as
a
deliverance
from
paine
the
effect
of
sicknesse
and
I
am
allmost
perswaded
God
snatched
him
from
us
least
he
might
have
ben
prevailed
with
by
the
number
of
petitions
to
have
left
him
still
amongst
us

If
you
suspect
kindness
in
me
makes
me
speake
too
much
Doctor
Parr
is
a
person
against
whome
you
cannot
object
it
was
he
who
preached
the
funerall
sermon
and
as
an
effect
of
truth
as
well
as
eloquence
he
himselfe
could
not
forbeare
weeping
in
the
pulpit

It
was
his
owne
expression
that
there
were
3
for
whome
he
had
infinitly
greeved
the
martyred
King
my
Lord
Primate
and
Doctor
Bretton
and
as
a
confirmation
of
the
right
that
was
done
him
in
that
oration
there
was
not
a
drie
eye
nor
a
dissenting
person

Should
I
confesse
the
reall
cause
it
is
y=r=
expectation
of
extraordinary
notions
of
things
wholy
out
of
my
way
Women
were
not
borne
to
reade
authors
and
censure
the
learned
to
compare
lives
and
judge
of
virtues
to
give
rules
of
morality
and
sacrifice
to
the
Muses

We
are
willing
to
acknowledge
all
time
borrowed
from
family
duties
is
misspent
the
care
of
children's
education
observing
a
husband's
comands
assisting
the
sick
relieving
the
poore
and
being
servicable
to
our
friends
are
of
sufficient
weight
to
employ
the
most
improved
capacities
amongst
us

If
sometimes
it
happens
by
accident
that
one
of
a
thousaud
aspires
a
little
higher
her
fate
commonly
exposes
her
to
wonder
but
adds
little
to
esteeme

The
distaff
will
defend
our
quarrels
as
well
as
the
sword
and
the
needle
is
as
instructive
as
the
penne

A
heroine
is
a
kinde
of
prodigy
the
influence
of
a
blasing
starre
is
not
more
dangerous
or
more
avoyded

Though
I
have
lived
under
the
roofe
of
the
learned
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
science
it
has
had
no
other
effect
on
such
a
temper
as
mine
but
that
of
admiration
aud
that
too
but
when
it
is
reduced
to
practice

I
confesse
I
am
infnitely
delighted
to
meet
with in
books
the
atchievements
of
the
heroes
with
the
calmnesse
of
philosophers
and
with
the
eloquence
of
orators
but
what
charms
me
irresistably
is
to
see
perfect
resignation
in
the
minds
of
men
what
ever
happens
adverse
to
them
in
their
fortune
that
is
being
knowing
and
truly
wise
it
confirms
my
beleefe
of
antiquity
and
engages
my
perswasion
of
future
perfection
without
which
it
were
in
vaine
to
live

Hope
not
for
volumes
or
treatises

may
make
me
goe
beyonde

Without

so
disposed
to
esteeme
me
againe
and
yet
that
is
not
the
chiefest
cause
of
my
affliction

I
might
wave
much
of
my
owne
interest
had
I
not
so
many
partners
that
will
suffer
equally

These
are
the
trialls
which
make
Christian
philosophy
usef'ull
not
only
by
a
resignation
to
the
Divine
decree
but
by
that
hope
which
encourages
us
to
expeet
a
more
lasting
happinesse
then
any
this
world
can
give
without
which
wee
were
extreamly
wretched
since
no
felicity
here
has
any
duration

The
greatest
conquerors
themselves
are
subject
to
this
unsteady
state
of
humane
nature
therefore
well
may
I
submitt
whose
concerns
are
triviall
in
respect
of
others

Yet
this
I
conclude
that
wee
dye
by
degrees
when
our
friends
go
before
us

But
whilst
I
discuss
this
with
you
I
should
consider
what
effects
melancholy
reflections
may
have
on
a
spleenetic
person
one
who
needes
not
cherish
that
temper

I
will
only
add
that
I
am
now
able
to
quitt
my
chamber
which
is
more
then
I
could
do
these
14
dayes
and
that
I
am
Sir
Your

am
extreamly
troubled
for
the

of
the

it

you

go
about

hath
been
upon
the
consideration

thereon

This
day

nine

night
and
hath
produced
these
three
votes

is
a
generall
apprehension

the
Hollanders
haue
already
made
their
conditions

I
must
beg
your
pardon
if
I
be
not
punctuall
for
you

third

Adjourned
early
to

their
Committee
time
till
three
in
the
afternoon
to
forme
their
three
Adresses

It
was
fiue
before
they
had
finished
and
first
they
reported
that
concerning
Duke
Lauderdale

The
Debate
indured
till
toward
nine
at
night

The
House
was
twice
divided

152
against
151
and
then
afterwards
161
against
157

whereby
all
the
words
of
the
whole
Adresse
were
thrown
but
so
that
there
remains
nothing
but
their
first
naked
vote

And
how
they
will
dispose
now
of
that
is
uncertaine
for
it
being
late
the
House
Adjourned
without
coming
to
any
further
Resolution

The
apprehensions
of
the
Hollanders
closing
up
their
Peace
with
France
do
still
continue
and
rather
increase

Gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
Yesterday
the
Committee
appointed
for
that
purpose
made
their
Report
of
this
Addresee
inclosed

But
as
soon
as
it
was
made
severall
Gentlemen
moved
not
to
proceed
in
it
further
but
to
expect
some
information
more
of
the
Resolutions
to
come
from
Holland

This
was
long
and
frequently
opposed
by
others

So
that
the
Debate
terminated
in
a
Division
of
the
House
the
most
numerous
that
I
remember
of
many
years
Wherein
by
176
against
174
it
was
carryed
to
proceed

The
second
of
169
against
166

both
carryed
in
the
Affirmative

And
the
whole
Addresse
as
I
send
it
you
was
agreed
and
the
Members
of
the
Privy
Counsell
ordered
to
desire
of
his
Majesty
the
time
when
the
House
might
wait
upon
him
with
it

It
was
then
moved
that
the
Houses
vote
against
Duke
Lauderdale
that
his
Majesty
may
further
humbly
be
desird
to
remove
him
from
his
Counsells
&
presence
might
be
added
to
this
Adresse
the
House
having
rejected
the
other
day
the
particular
forme
in
which
it
was
drawn
up

This
admitting
a
Debate
and
the
House
hauing
already
sate
the
whole
day
till
fiue
a
clock
some
moved
to
Adjourne
which
came
at
last
to
be
the
Question
and
the
House
being
Divided
upon
it
it
was
carryed
by
158
against
150
not
to
Adjourne

So
they
proceeded
on
and
it
was
without
any
Division
more
voted
to
Add
him
to
the
Adresse

It
happend
in
one
of
the
former
Divisions
that
on
some
occasion
in
the
Lobby
there
were
Blows
giuen
between
S=r=
Thomas
Chichley
Master
of
the
Ordinance
&
the
Lord
Obrian
though
both
of
the
same
Party

The
House
orderd
S=r=
Thomas
who
was
present
&
the
L
Obrian
who
absented
to
be
taken
into
custody
of
their
Sergent
at
Arms

Both
were
avoyded
by
the
Question
whether
the
Debate
should
be
Adjournd
w=ch=
past
by
168
against
167
in
the
negatiue
&
so
fell

They
with
their
Adresse
waited
since
on
the
King
who
seemd
dissastisfied

God
grant
better

Gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
I
have
very
litle
subject
of
writing
the
present
businesse
of
Parliament
hauing
been
all
concluded
yesterday
morning

For
his
Majesty
sent
up
for
the
Commons
to
the
House
of
Lords
and
Prorogued
the
Parliament
till
the
twenty
third
of
this
moneth

You
know
that
always
upon
Prorogation
whatsoever
businesse
was
imperfect
and
depending
is
quite
cut
of
and
if
the
Parliament
intend
to
proceede
againe
upon
it
they
must
resume
all
from
the
very
beginning

One
thing
you
may
please
to
take
notice
of
that
the
Corne-clause
is
by
the
period
of
this
Session
expired

I
doubt
not
but
many
will
reflect
upon
this
Prorogation
for
other
reasons

But
they
that
discourse
the
lest
and
thinke
the
best
of
it
will
be
the
wisest
men
and
the
best
Subjects

God
in
mercy
direct
his
Majesty
always
to
that
which
may
most
conduce
to
his
own
and
the
Kingdomes
happinesse

remaine
Gentlemen
&c
Your
most
affectionate
Servant

1678

Gentlemen
my
very
Worthy
friends
His
Majesty
open'd
this
Session
with
the
Speech
which
I
send
you
inclosed

And
after
that
the
Lord
Chancellour
spoke
at
large
but
the
Copy
of
it
not
hauing
been
communicated
to
the
House
of
Commons
they
appointed
a
Committee
to
peruse
the
Lords
Journall
for
it
where
such
things
are
of
course
to
be
entred

The
rest
of
their
time
was
spent
in
settling
the
ordinary
affaires
of
their
House
appointing
days
for
their
Grand
Committees
naming
and
impowring
their
Committee
of
Privileges
and
renewing
the
Clause
against
Bribery
or
interteinments
in
order
to
Elections
and
lastly
in
receiving
severall
Petitions
concerning
undue
Elections

What
I
remarke
in
the
House
is
that
it
is
much
fuller
then
ordinary
and
more
are
still
upon
the
Road
and
there
seems
a
more
then
usuall
concernment
among
all
men
as
if
some
great
and
I
hope
good
thing
were
to
be
expected

God
in
his
mercy
direct
all
to
the
best

What
I
understand
thereof
I
shall
from
time
to
time
communicate
to
you
remaining
Gentlemen
&c
Your
most
affectionate
Servant

Gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
The
house
of
Commons
not
having
the
Chancellor's
Speech
that
day
printed
or
written
sate
(
I
meane
yesterday
not
long
nor
did
much
worke

The
Bill
for
incouragement
of
the
woollen
manufacture
which
was
in
progresse
last
Session
was
read
the
first
time

They
also
appointed
a
Committee
to
bring
in
a
Bill
or
Bills
to
hinder
the
growth
of
Popery

to day
(
which
was
intended
though
not
ordered
for
consideration
of
his
Majestyes
and
the
Chancelors
speech
but
the
morning
being
most
part
spent
before
the
Speeches
were
published
there
was
a
Motion
made
for
an
humble
Addresse
to
his
Majesty
to
know
of
him
the
State
of
Affairs
as
they
now
stand
in
relation
to
War
or
Peace
and
that
if
his
Majesty
shall
thinke
fit
to
enter
into
a
Warre
with
the
French
King
with
the
Assistance
of
the
Emperour
and
such
other
Princes
and
States
as
shall
come
into
the
Confederacy
this
House
will
support
and
assist
his
Majesty
in
the
carrying
on
the
Warre

This
debate
tooke
up
the
whole
day
forasmuch
as
some
counted
this
Adresse
to
be
unseasonable
when
it
appeard
that
all
things
abroad
were
so
disposed
toward
a
Peace
Some
thought
it
more
requisite
to
proceed
first
of
all
to
the
disbanding
of
the
Army
others
that
it
were
best
to
lay
by
all
apprehensions
and
jealousyes
&
to
furnish
the
King
with
mony
leaving
the
rest
to
his
M=tyes=
discretion

In
this
variety
of
opinions
the
House
came
about
foure
a
clock
to
a
Question
of
Adjourning
the
Debate
w=ch=
was
carryed
in
the
Affirmatiue
by
195
against
176

In
generall
what
I
learne
by
information
both
within
and
without
doors
is
that
both
Holland
&
Spaine
appeare
to
be
agreed
upon
termes
with
France

I
have
inclosed
the
Speeches

I
remaine
Gentlemen
&c
Your
most
affectionate
servant
Andr
Marvell

June
18.78

Gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
Yesterday
the
House
of
Common
past
the
Bill
for
exportation
of
Leather
and
sent
it
up
to
the
Lords

Next
upon
Diuision
of
149
to
142

That
it
appears
that
40000
=li=
hath
been
borrowed
on
the
Excise
&
expended
for
the
extraordinary
charge
of
the
Ordinance
in
the
yeare
1677

to day
being
the
last
on
which
any
new
motion
could
be
made
for
supply
his
M=ty=
commanded
the
House
to
wait
on
him
in
the
House
of
Lords
when
he
spoke
long
to
them
but
it
hath
been
impossible
for
me
to
send
you
a
Copy
of
the
Speech
the
House
having
sate
all
day
till
seven
in
the
Euening

But
the
most
remarkable
point
was
that
his
M=ty=
desired
beside
these
supplyes
already
in
Prospect
to
be
further
furnished
with
an
additionall
Revenue
for
his
Life
of
300000
=li=
a
yeare
on
w=ch=
condition
he
would
appropriate
500000
=li=
a
yeare
to
the
Nauy

Also
40000
=li=
for
the
Princesse
of
Orange's
portion

And
signifyd
there
might
be
a
Recesse
toward
the
middle
of
the
next
month

They
first
voted
Thanks
to
be
presented
by
the
Privy
Counsell
for
the
Gracious
Expressions
in
his
speech

Then
after
long
Debate
they
voted
without
trying
the
Diuision
that
they
would
not
go
into
Committee
of
the
House
for
raising
a
Revenue
of
300000
=li=
a
yeare
for
his
M=tys=
life

But
next
to
go
to morrow
into
a
Committee
of
the
Whole
House
to
consider
of
the
Motion
for
continuing
the
imposition
on
wines
as
also
of
the
way
of
raising
the
200000
=li=
to
w=ch=
they
are
obliged
and
the
other
2
or
300000
=li=
for
the
Charge
of
this
Fleet
&
to
consider
the
Motion
for
40000
=li=
Portion

From
hence
these
things
being
thus
settled
they
entred
into
a
great
debate
of
looking
into
the
Privy
Seals
for
secret
service
since
1
of
May
-77

&
of
taking
account
what
Pensions
on
the
Revenue

And
then
of
a
Test
for
the
Members
that
they
had
not
been
bribed
&
a
great
many
heads
more

Twas
late
but
carryed
not
to
adjourn
by
173
against
103

Then
at
last
the
Question
was
put
for
a
Committee
to
draw
up
such
a
Test

It
fell
by
a
Division
of
100
to
86

I
remaine
Gentlemen
&c
Your
most
affectionate
servant
Andr
Marvell

The
House
sate
the
most
part
of
the
Day
in
Committee
of
the
Whole
House
upon
the
matters
of
Supply
which
I
mentioned
formerly

And
in
conclusion
they
agreed
(
not
reckoning
in
the
200000
=li=
already
past
for
the
Disbanding
the
Army
that
in
discharge
of
the
200000
=li=
borrowd
on
the
Excise
and
of
the
Extraordinary
Charge
of
the
Fleet
and
for
the
payment
of
40000
=li=
for
the
Princesse
of
Oranges
Portion
there
should
be
in
all
414000
=li=
more
raised

But
of
the
way
of
Levying
it
there
is
yet
nothing
resolved
though
severall
things
were
propounded

to day
the
Bill
for
Wearing
of
Woollen
and
that
against
Papists
sitting
in
either
House
of
Parliament
were
both
Reported
and
Ordered
to
be
ingrossed

They
should
have
went
then
againe
into
Committee
about
the
way
of
raising
this
Mony
but
the
Lords
hauing
sent
down
the
Disbanding
Bill
with
some
Amendments
diverted
it

The
Lords
haue
alterd
the
last
of
June
which
the
Commons
had
fixed
for
Disbanding
all
the
Forces
except
those
in
Flanders
to
the
27=th=
of
July
&
giuen
those
in
Flanders
a
further
terme
as
I
remember
to
the
24=th=
of
August

The
Debate
did
principally
run
upon
the
27=th=
of
July
&
the
Commons
haue
voted
that
they
Disagree
and
haue
ordered
a
Committee
to
prepare
Reasons
of
this
Disagreement
to
be
presented
to
the
Lords
at
a
Conference

They
haue
Resolued
also
to
sit
on
Munday
although
it
be
an
Holy-day
being
very
intent
to
dispatch
all
businesse
as
soon
as
possible
For
many
Members
go
daily
away
and
all
here
are
weary

I
remaine
Gentlemen
&c
Your
most
affectionate
servant
Andr
Marvell

Gentlemen
my
very
worthy
friends
Since
my
last
the
Bill
for
wearing
of
Woollen
hath
been
read
the
third
time
past
and
sent
up
to
the
Lords

Also
the
Bill
for
continuing
the
new
Impost
upon
Wines
and
Vinegars
hath
been
read
the
first
time

There
was
moreover
a
Bill
brought
into
day
and
once
read
for
supplying
certain
defects
in
the
French
Prohibition
explaining
the
ships
to
be
subject
to
seisure
which
fraudently
put
in
to
ports
&
ly
there
without
apparent
necessity
and
making
the
Informers
part
more
certain
and
easy
to
come
by
&c
They
sent
also
by
some
of
their
members
to
a
Conference
with
the
Lords
about
the
Disbanding
Bill
a
Provisio
w=ch=
they
desired
might
in
lieu
of
the
Lords
Amendments
be
added
to
the
Bill
whereby
in
case
any
part
of
the
Army
can not
be
disbanded
by
the
last
of
this
Moneth
there
may
be
more
time
allowed
so
that
the
whole
do
not
exceed
the
Terms
in
the
Bill
above
30
dayes

I
heare
that
the
Lords
are
likely
although
it
comes
so
neare
to
their
own
sense
yet
to
disagree
in
it

The
House
of
Commons
haue
both
to day
and
yesterday
been

Committee
about
the

a
second
Act
for
Review
of

the

at

Resolved
(
Agreeing

414000
=li=

the

And

have
appointed
to
goe
againe
to morrow
into
Committee
in
order
to
the
further
consideration
of

You
may
remember
I
writt
unto

some
weekes

concerning
a

Mr

Blennerhaysett
commonly
called
Mr.

hindred
his
Journey
then
intended

Butt
hee
intendeth
God
willing
to
bee
in
London
on
Tuesday
next

I
presume
you
have
my
letter
wch
I
then
writt
pray
peruse
it
and
knowe
that
hee
sayth
hee
hath
had
some
gleeting
at
the
penis
at
times
a
great
while
hee
came
about
Michaelmas
last
to
Dr
Blincolne
and
myself
and
hee
tooke
some
mercuriall
medicines
and
decoctions
and
dyet
drincks
and
grewe
well
as
hee
sayd
only
I
understand
from
him
that
hee
is
not
free
from
gleeting
sometimes
and
also
hath
some
inabillity
as
to
erection

Therefore
I
would
have
you
to
vewe
the
penis
diligently
and
you
may
also
take
in
my
Cosen
Hobbs
hee
will
staye
about
3
weekes
if
thought
fitt
for
the
use
of
any
medicines
or
course

Hee
intendeth
to
marry
and
hath
settled
affection
upon
a
good
gentlewoeman
and
is
in
a
manner
agreed
butt
it
were
fitt
hee
should
be
in
such
a
state
of
body
as
might
bee
safe
and
congruus
unto
both

Consider
therefore
well
of
it
and
do
all
with
the
best
secresy
possible
for
hee
is
very
Jealous
and
apt
to
bee
meticulous
and
is
hypochondricall

Some
additions
would
bee
made
I
writt
one
to
you
concerning
Hippocrates
that
hee
practised
in
Thessalie
and
mentions
divers
patients
of
Larissa
and
therefore
looke
out
that
paper
and
if
you
have
lost
it
give
mee
notice
for
that
is
a
materiall
observation
especially
unto
physitians
and
schollars

Tis
an
odde
passage
concerning
the
French
Kings
getting
Savoy
and
Piedmont
into
his
hand
for
money
and
it
will
concerne
many
States
and
make
them
looke
about
them

Though
hee
had
a
good
army
yet
tis
thought
hee
hath
prevayled
much
by
his
money
in
all
the
warre
and
current
of
his
affayres

The
rising
in
scotland
falls
out
unhappily
at
this
time
many
will
wish
that
the
parliament
were
sitting
butt
some
Jealous
people
will
thinck
that
this
may
rather
hinder
their
sitting

I
am
glad
the
buisinesse
succeeded
so
well
at
Halstead

Dear
son
I
heard
that
some
shipps
passed
by
Yarmouth
with
souldiers
in
them
for
Scotland
6
or
7
dayes
past
and
the
coffie
and
common
newes
letters
tell
us
something
of
the
rebellion
in
Scotland
butt
I
thinck
very
imperfectly

A
litle
more
time
will
better
informe
us
of
that
buisinesse
and
they
are
like
to
bee
more
effectually
dealt
with
and
brought
to
reason
by
the
English
forces
when
there
shall
bee
a
sufficient
number
of
them
in
Scotland
for
the
rebells
hope
and
others
doubt
whether
those
of
their
nation
will
fight
heartily
agaynst
them
for
tis
sayd
there
are
more
discontented
in
Scotland
then
those
yet
in
armes
so
that
this
may
bee
a
coal
not
so
soone
quenched
though
it
was
begun
by
the
lowest
Scots
yet
the
Scots
are
very
tenacious
of
the
protestant
religion
&
have
entertained
feares
&
jealosies
of
dessignes
to
introduce
the
Roman
from
their
observation
of
the
affayres
in
England
&
are
not
like
to
bee
quieted
long
without
a
parliament
&
if
that
should
bee
broake
of
to
their
discontent
they
would
be
contriving
agayne
&
the
English
parliaments
would
bee
butt
cold
in
suppressing
them

When
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
giveth
a
farther
account
wee
may
see
farther
into
the
buisinesse

When
the
wether
proves
cold
&
fitt
for
dissections
if
you
have
opportunity
take
notice
of
a
beare
tis
commonly
sayd
that
a
beare
hath
no
breast
bone
&
that
hee
cannot
well
runne
downe
a
hill
his
heart
will
so
come
up
toward
his
throat

This
day
one
came
to
showe
mee
a
booke
&
to
sell
it
it
was
a
hortus
hyemalis
in
a
booke
made
at
Padua
butt
I
had
seen
it
above
thirtie
yeares
ago
&
it
containes
not
many
plants

You
had
a
very
good
one
or

if
you
have
not
parted

Dear
Son
I
was
very
glad
to
receave
your
last
Letter

God
hath
heard
our
prayers
&
I
hope
will
blesse
you
still

I
thought
myself
rich
enough
till
my
children
grewe
up

Bee
carefull
of
yourself
and
temperate
that
you
may
bee
able
to
go
thorough
your
practise
for
to
attayne
to
the
getting
of
a
thousand
pounds
a
yeare
requires
no
small
labour
of
body
and
mind
and
is
a
life
not
much
lesse
paynfull
&
laborious
then
that
of
the
meaner
sort
of
people
go
thorough

When
you
putt
out
your
money
bee
well
assured
of
the
assurance
&
bee
wise
therin
from
what
your
father
hath
suffered

It
is
laudable
to
dwell
handsomely
butt
bee
not
to
forward
to
build
or
sett
forth
another
mans
howse
or
so
to
fill
it
that
it
may
encrease
the
fuell
if
God
should
please
to
send
fire

The
mercifull
God
direct
you
in
all

Excesse
in
Apparell
&
chargeable
dresses
are
got
into
the
country
especially
among
woemen
men
go
decently
&
playne
enough

The
last
Assizes
there
was
a
concourse
of
woemen
at
that
they
call
my
Lords
garden
in
Cunsford
&
so
richly
dressed
that
some
strangers
sayd
there
was
scarce
the
like
to
bee
seen
at
Hide
park
which
makes
charity
cold

Wee
now
beare
that
this
parliament
shall
sitt
the
21
of
October
which
will
make
London
very
full
in
Michaelmas
terme

I
have
read
all
or
most
of
Dr
Love's
booke
which
is
a
pretty
booke
&
gives
a
good
account
of
the
Lowe
countrey
practise
in
that
disease
&
hath
some
other
observables

I
knew
one
Mr
Christopher
Love
sonne

Dr
Love
warden
of
Winchester
Colledge
who
was
an
active
man
agaynst
the
King
in
the
late
warres
and
gott

great
estate

I
thinck
he
was
fayne
to
fly
upon
the
Kings
restauration

If
the
chirurgeons
have
made
choyce
of
new
officers
'tis
probable
they
may
agree
&
so
you
may
read

next
Lent

The
King
comes
to

A

Perhaps

not
bee

never
sawe

Since

not

How
to
expresse
the
sorrow
for
parting
with
so
deare
a
child
is
a
difficult
task

She
was
welcome
to
me
from
the
first
moment
God
gave
her
acceptable
through
the
whole
course
of
her
life
by
a
thousand
endearments
by
the
gifts
of
nature
by
acquired
parts
by
the
tender
love
she
ever
shew'd
her
father
and
me
a
thred
of
piety
accompanyed
all
her
actions
and
now
proves
out
greatest
consolation

The
patience
resignation
humility
of
her
carriage
in
so
severe
and
fatall
a
disease
discover'd
more
than
an
ordinary
assistance
of
the
Divine
goodnesse
never
expressing
feare
of
death
or
a
desire
to
live
but
for
her
friends
sake

The
seaventh
day
of
her
illnesse
she
discoursed
to
me
in
particular
as
calmly
as
in
health
desir'd
to
confesse
and
receive
the
blessed
Sacrament
which
she
perform'd
with
great
devotion
after
which
tho'
in
her
perfect
senses
to
the
last
she
never
signified
the
least
concerne
for
the
world
prayed
often
and
resigned
her
soule.—
What
shall
I
say

She
was
too
great
a
blessing
for
me
who
never
deserved
any thing
much
lesse
such
a
jewell

what
are
the
charms
that
keep
our
minds
in
suspence

without
the
conversation
of
those
we
love
what
is
life
worth

How
did
I
propose
happinesse
this
sum'er
in
the
returne
of
y=r=
L=p=
and
my
deare
child
—
for
she
was
absent
almost
all
this
winter

She
had
much
improved
her selfe
by
the
remarks
she
had
made
of
the
world
and
all
its
vanities
—
What
shall
I
add

I
could
ever
speake
of
her
and
might
I
be
just
to
her
without
suspition
of
partiality
could
tell
you
many
things

The
papers
which
are
found
in
her
cabinet
discover
she
profited
by
her
readyng
such
reflections
collections
out
of
Scripture
confessions
meditations
and
pious
notions
evidence
her
time
was
not
spent
in
the
trifling
way
of
most
young
women

I
acknowledge
as
a
Christian
I
ought
not
to
murmur
and
I
should
be
infinitly
sorry
to
incur
God's
further
displeasure

There
are
those
yet
remaining
that
challenge
my
care
and
for
their
sakes
I
endeavour
to
submitt
a
for
her
kind
concerne
and
wishe
she
may
live
to
be
the
comfort
you
deserve
in
her
that
God
will
continue
the
blessing
to
both
and
make
you
happy
which
is
the
prayor
of
her
who
is
Y=rs=
most
affectionately

For
after
all
that
you
do
or
can
say
in
magnifying
this
essay
of
mine
I
must
consider
it
as
but
a
faint
offer
at
some
kind
of
acknowledgment
for
your
favours
and
I
beseeech
you
to
receive
it
as
such
from
one
who
wishes
for
nothing
more
than
the
of
opportunities
of
showing
how
sensible
he
is
of
them

Upon
this
confidence
and
the
good
success
you
assure
me
our
method
hath
hitherto
had
I
venture
to
trouble
you
with
the
remainder
of
my
thoughts
on
that
subject
and
in
this
one
more
long
sheet
you
will
find
I
am
come
to
the
end
of
my
tether

For
having
conducted
my
young
master
to
the
age
when
he
will
be
got
out
of
the
hands
of
masters
and
tutors
we
are
at
the
bounds
of
what
is
said
to
concern
education

I
do
not
pretend
though
I
am
now
come
to
the
conclusion
that
I
have
given
you
a
just
treatise
on
this
matter

There
are
a
thousand
other
things
that
may
need
consideration
especially
if
one
should
take
in
the
various
tempers
different
inclinations
and
particular
defaults
that
are
to
be
found
in
children
and
prescribe
proper
remedies
to
each
of
them

But
in
this
tumultuary
draft
I
have
made
for
your
son
I
have
considered
him
barely
as
white
paper
as
a
piece
of
wax
to
be
moulded
and
fashioned
and
therefore
have
only
touched
those
heads
which
I
judged
necessary
to
the
breeding
of
a
young
gentleman
of
his
condition
in
general

And
though
I
have
with
a
great
deal
of
freedom
given
you
my
opinion
concerning
all
those
things
that
came
in
my
thoughts
and
appeared
material
yet
I
am
too
sensible
of
my
want
of
experience
in
this
affair
and
the
oversights
I
am
liable
to
to
think
that
I
have
writ
approaches
anything
more
perfect
even
in
that
kind

You
must
not
therefore
though
I
am
come
to
the
end
look
on
it
as
a
treatise
wich
I
put
into
your
hands
for
complete

For
since
I
shall
not
scruple
to
trouble
you
with
anything
else
on
this
subject
which
may
at
any
time
hereafter
come
into
my
thoughts
you
may
be
sure
I
shall
much
more
readily
do
so
when
you
shall
set
me
on
work
or
propose
any
new
matter
you
shall
find
wanting
which
your
care
and
concern
for
your
dear
little
ones
cannot
(
I
conclude
fail
to
suggest
to
you
in
abundance
it
being
a
fate
that
usually
attends
the
speculations
which
contemplative
men
have
pleased
themselves
with
in
their
studies
to
be
found
very
defective
when
they
come
to
be
put
in
practice

As
to
remedies
for
peculiar
disorders
the
account
you
give
me
of
your
son
makes
me
think
I
shall
have
little
to
say
on
that
occasion

You
will
not
suspect
I
flatter
you
when
I
say
his
temper
is
as
one
could
wish
and
the
love
of
reason
he
shows
in
his
inquiries
and
discourses
is
as
much
to
be
preferred
to
that
prattling
quickness
which
we
are
apt
to
be
delighted
in
with
children
as
a
healthy
well-made
boy
is
to
a
gaudy
suit
and
if
it
were
necesssary
there
I
think
I
could
show
you
that
that
witty
pertness
that
appears
sometimes
so
early
proceeds
from
a
principle
that
seldom
accompanies
a
strong
constitution
of
body
or
ripens
into
a
strong
judgment
of
mind

And
if
you
desire
to
have
him
a
more
brisk
talker
I
believe
I
could
teach
you
the
way
to
make
him
so

But
I
find
you
had
rather
your
son
should
be
able
and
useful
when
a
man
the
pretty
company
and
diversion
to
others
whilst
a
child
though
if
that
too
were
to
be
considered
I
think
I
may
say
there
is
not
so
much
pleasure
to
have
a
child
prattle
agreeably
as
to
reason
well

Encourage
therfore
his
inquisitiveness
all
you
can
by
satisfying
his
demands
and
inform
his
judgment
as
far
as
it
is
capable

When
his
reasons
are
any
way
tolerable
let
him
find
the
credit
and
commendation
of
it

and
when
they
are
quite
out
of
the
way
let
him
without
being
laughed
at
for
his
mistake
be
gently
put
into
the
right
and
can
take
care
as
much
as
you
can
that
in
this
inclination
he
shows
to
reason
about
everything
nobody
baulk
or
impose
upon
him

I
now
add
that
if
it
be
possible
you
should
get
it
with
pictures
which
will
in
a
temper
like
his
(
that
if
I
mistake
not
is
much
more
pleased
with
things
than
names
make
the
learning
of
characters
and
words
go
down
much
easier
when
he
sees
there
is
some
use
of
it
and
that
the
knowledge
of
beasts
and
birds
and
such
other
things
comes
along
with
it
those
visible
objects
children
heard
talked
of
in
vain
and
without
any
satisfaction
whilst
thet
have
no
ideas
of
them

If
therfore
’sop's
Fables
or
some
such
other
book
cannot
be
got
with
pictures
yet
at
least
get
him
what
picturs
of
animals
you
can
with
the
names
of
them
which
at
the
same
time
will
encourage
him
to
read
and
afford
him
matter
of
enquiry
and
knowledge

If
you
find
it
with
difficulty
to
meet
with
such
a
tutor
as
we
desire
I
do
not
at
all
wonder

I
can
only
say
spare
no
care
nor
cost
to
get
such
an
one

All
things
are
to
be
had
that
way
and
I
dare
assure
you
that
if
you
get
a
good
one
you
will
never
repent
the
charge
but
you
will
always
have
the
satisfaction
to
think
it
the
money
of
all
others
the
best
laid
out

But
be
sure
take
nobody
upon
friends
or
charitable
no
nor
great
commendations

Inform
yourselves
throughly
whether
he
be
for
your
purpose
and
when
you
find
him
every
way
so
get
him
at
any
rate

But
whether
he
be
such
an
one
as
I
have
formerly
mentioned
and
your
design
will
need
you
alone
can
judge
nor
will
the
reputation
of
a
sober
man
with
learning
enough
(
which
with
others
is
all
usually
that
is
required
in
a
tutor
serve
your
turn

When
I
consider
the
scruples
and
cautions
I
here
lay
in
your
way
methinks
it
looks
as
if
I
advised
you
to
something
which
I
would
have
you
offer
at
but
in
effect
not
do

but
you
know
how
much
I
am
in
earnest
in
this
point
only
you
will
understand
me
aright
if
you
think
it
a
business
you
ought
to
be
very
nice
in

When
you
have
pitched
on
one
after
having
had
him
awhile
with
you
tell
me
what
kind
of
a
man
he
is
I
will
then
the
best
I
can
tell
you
what
kind
of
use
you
are
to
make
of
him

As
to
the
business
with
Stratton
I
have
nothing
to
say
but
leave
it
wholly
to
your
judgment
for
so
as
you
determine
I
know
it
will
be
well

Present
my
humble
service
to
Madam
and
tell
her
I
am
glad
the
little
ones
follow
so
well
the
footsteps
of
their
mother
that
they
begin
to
have
a
reputation
so
early

I
wish
her
and
them
health
that
she
may
long
enjoy
that
growing
satisfaction

I
wish
you
with
them
all
happiness
and
am
Sir
your
most
humble
servant
J.L

15th
march

But
to
enter
into
a
dispute
with
you
wherein
an
excess
of
friendship
makes
you
obstinate
I
have
another
reason
to
suspect
that
your
consideration
for
the
person
that
gave
it
makes
you
overlook
many
things
in
the
advice
itself
since
that
I
receive
not
from
you
any
objections
about
any
part
of
it

For
though
I
must
own
it
is
according
to
the
best
of
my
skill
and
though
I
know
the
affection
I
writ
it
with
to
be
very
sincere
yet
I
can
by
no
means
fancy
my
opinion
infallible
or
that
it
should
in
all
things
so
exactly
jump
with
yours
and
madam's
that
you
should
find
nothing
(
in
what
is
already
put
in
practice
to
be
added
omitted
or
altered
whereof
however
you
say
nothing
at
all

For
I
doubt
not
but
when
I
revise
the
foul
copy
which
I
keep
by
me
on
purpose
I
shall
myself
find
occasion
for
additions
or
alterations

I
do
not
at
all
wonder
that
you
have
not
yet
found
a
tutor
to
your
mind
and
I
confess
the
truth
somewhat
pleased
with
it

Not
that
you
are
hitherto
disappointed
but
that
I
perceive
that
you
are
more
curious
in
your
choice
than
to
take
up
a
venture
with
the
first
or
second
that
comes
in
your
way

'Tis
of
great
consequence
to
your
son
and
therfore
you
cannot
be
too
nice
in
it

If
you
could
get
your
cousin
to
Chipley
a
sober
well
conditioned
young
man
with
moderate
learning
would
do
the
business
but
you
know
his
humour
and
how
averse
to
trouble
especially
of
some
kind

But
as
to
the
law
suit
I
mentioned
in
my
last
I
conclude
upon
second
thoughts
that
it
is
best
to
let
it
perfectly
alone
without
meddling
at
all
in
it
any
farther
than
Earl
Pembroke
himself
shall
of
his
own
accord
discourse
of
his
own
concerns
and
give
his
advice
about
it
and
then
it
would
perhaps
be
not
amiss
to
enquire
and
reason
with
him
for
your
own
satisfaction
of
the
grounds
he
proceeds
on

For
example
the
key
put
in
at
the
keyhold
a
must
be
turned
by
b-c-d
quite
to
b
again
and
from
b
be
turned
back
again
to
d
and
there
let
stand
and
then
the
lid
of
the
chest
may
be
lifted
up

This
I
am
sure
is
the
just
quantity
of
the
motion
that
the
key
must
have
and
I
think
for
making
it
you
must
begin
the
motion
with
the
sun
but
this
I
do
not
perfectly
remember
and
therfore
nothing
must
be
forced
in
the
case
for
if
the
contrary
motion
from
a
to
d
and
so
round
be
the
way
to
open
it
you
must
do
the
quite
contrary
in
all
things

When
it
is
open
you
will
find
one
turn
to
lock
it
as
it
does
other
locks

This
much
I
remember
of
the
lock
itself
but
where
the
chest
itself
is
that
the
executors
know
I
for
my
part
know
not

This
I
only
know
that
if
you
can
persuade
my
cousin
somerton
and
his
wife
to
make
use
of
it
and
remove
thither
(
which
I
should
advise
him
to
if
the
plantation
flourishes
and
promises
any
good
he
may
have
this
interest
for
acceptance

As
you
are
content
your
pictures
should
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
merchant
here
that
bought
them
for
you
till
you
have
informed
yourself
concerning
that
sort
of
merchandise
and
to
what
port
either
london
or
exeter
you
were
best
have
them
so
I
find
he
is
not
in
hast
for
the
slate
of
the
account
between
you
which
therefore
you
need
not
be
at
the
pains
to
send
till
he
demand
it

He
hopes
as
I
perceive
that
this
shall
not
be
the
last
business
he
shall
have
with
you
and
therfore
expects
not
to
have
the
just
balance
returned
but
an
entire
sum
something
near
it
may
serve
the
turn

The
rest
I
perceive
he
is
not
troubled
should
remain
as
a
nest
egg
till
a
farther
occasion
as
much
as
I
know
of
him
he
is
a
very
fair
conditioned
man
and
knows
very
well
your
character

My
service
also
to
my
Valentine
Susan
and
her
man
Thomas
and
to
all
you
mention
in
your
last
letter

Sutton
business
dissatisfies
me
mightily

If
that
estate
will
yield
nothing
by
the
year
I
am
of
opinion
you
should
sell
it
and
make
present
money
of
it
at
least
the
very
proposition
will
quicken
the
man
that
deceived
you
and
your
aunt
so
scurvily

My
most
humble
service
to
your
Lady
and
little
ones

I
am
Sir
your
most
humble
servant
J.L

I
hope
you
will
talk
at
large
and
fully
with
Adrian

He
that
copied
my
last
long
letter
mistook
in
the
names
of
some
books
which
I
much
desire
you
to
correct
and
for
Bacon
to
set
down
Chillingworth
and
for
Tacitus
Tully

I
sent
you
lately
a
part
of
my
reasonings
de
intellectu
humano
which
I
hope
came
safe
for
you
know
we
are
all
concerned
for
our
own
conceptions
how
idle
soever

Sir
Though
I
have
taken
so
much
pains
in
my
business
and
recovered
more
of
haroll
than
I
expected
or
I
believe
I
should
have
done
had
I
been
there
myself
yet
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
you
will
permit
me
to
give
you
thanks

But
whatever
right
you
think
you
have
particularly
to
do
me
all
the
kindness
imaginable
I
crave
leave
to
be
sensible
of
your
favours
and
to
be
sorry
it
lies
not
in
my
power
to
make
acknowledgments
that
may
bear
any
proportion
with
them
I
could
not
forbear
saying
this
much
to
you
and
send
you
half
a
dozen
lines
of
acknowledgment
after
you
had
spent
the
greatest
part
of
twelve
days
in
a
most
troublesome
affair
of
mine

And
therfore
pray
pardon
me
and
believe
that
I
have
no
compliments
for
you
though
I
have
all
the
true
esteem
and
affection
one
friend
can
have
for
another

I
fear
Mr.
Stratton
is
but
a
slow
man
of
london

I
put
something
into
one
of
my
letters
to
you
to
quicken
him

Whether
you
received
it
or
thought
fit
to
make
use
of
it
I
know
not

But
in
good
earnest
it
were
better
that
little
tenement
were
reduced
into
money
than
to
yield
no
other
income
but
trouble
to
me
or
my
friends
though
I
doubt
whether
chapmen
are
there
to
be
had

I
was
sorry
to
hear
by
yours
of
30th
August
of
the
death
of
your
man

I
have
therefore
taken
order
to
have
some
got
for
you
therefore
pray
take
order
with
Mr.
Elwill
about
them
for
to
him
they
will
be
consigned

With
them
you
will
also
receive
some
Muscovy
or
Russian
cabbage
seed
and
some
blood
red
cabbage
seed
which
they
look
on
here
as
the
wholesomest
of
all
and
perhaps
not
without
reason
for
let
me
tell
you
this
as
a
thing
worth
your
remembrance
that
it
is
one
of
the
best
remedies
I
know
against
the
scurvy

Besides
boiling
of
it
as
we
do
our
cabbage
ordinarily
they
use
it
here
also
raw
as
their
constant
winter
salad
having
always
a
store
of
them
for
the
winter
which
I
am
told
the
gardeners
preserve
by
laying
them
in
straw
in
deep
holes
dug
into
the
ground
on
purpose

Their
way
of
using
them
for
salads
is
this
they
take
a
cabbage
and
slice
as
much
of
it
off
as
will
serve
for
the
present
meal
just
as
you
would
slice
a
cucumber

Whereby
the
leaves
being
cut
across
fall
into
little
shreds
which
look
handsomely
in
the
dish
and
dressed
with
oil
and
vinegar
is
no
ill
salad

And
if
you
keep
your
counsel
well
I
believe
be
scarce
known
what
it
is
and
the
truth
is
being
very
wholesome
if
I
were
there
I
would
bring
it
into
use
under
some
fine
new
name
for
after
I
had
been
a
little
accustomed
to
it
I
eat
it
with
pleasure

I
wonder
you
had
not
heard
by
the
2nd
of
October
of
several
sorts
of
seeds
sent
you
by
a
neighbour
of
yours
and
the
third
book
De
intellectu
humano
sent
by
the
same
hand

Pray
when
you
go
to
market
enquire
after
them
if
you
have
no
news
of
them
sooner

If
you
cannot
learn
that
the
timber
is
good
for
something
I
advise
you
to
plant
no
more
of
them
than
you
have
need
of
for
some
present
shade
or
shelter

For
if
they
are
not
good
timber
they
are
not
beautiful
there
is
nothing
recommends
them
but
their
quick
growth
and
for
me
I
little
value
unless
it
be
some
present
need
things
that
are
soon
ripe
and
soon
rotten

Indeed
I
have
heard
that
their
boards
are
almost
as
good
as
deal
for
floorings
of
rooms
and
dry
uses
but
I
doubt
it

In
a
rich
soil
like
yours
where
all
things
grow
so
well
I
should
choose
to
have
a
walk
up
to
the
front
of
the
house
of
limes
only
for
beauty
two
rows
of
a
side
and
a
space
between
them
as
broad
as
the
front
of
your
house
or
ten
or
fifteen
foot
broader
as
I
formerly
told
you

But
behind
the
house
I
would
have
a
walk
of
the
same
fashion
of
elms
and
on
the
sides
of
other
useful
trees
(
perhaps
oak
should
be
one
which
will
serve
for
beauty
and
use
too
and
pay
for
their
standing

Abeles
I
would
only
place
either
where
others
will
not
grow
or
where
I
have
need
of
a
present
fence
and
then
I
would
place
oaks
amongst
them
or
behind
them
which
is
better
which
might
do
the
business
when
they
are
gone
but
not
knowing
your
design
I
talk
at
random
though
with
a
good
intention

Pray
remember
me
to
your
Spa
friends

Pray
observe
nicely
without
letting
them
perceive
that
you
do
so
how
I
stand
in
each
of
their
books

The
seedsman
tells
me
the
skipper
brings
word
that
he
came
too
late
to
Norway

I
fear
this
an
excuse
for
I
had
bespoke
them
before
you
writ
to
me
but
what
remedy

I
must
be
content
with
a
promise
for
another
year

I
fear
by
your
silence
you
are
not
yet
provided
of
a
man
such
as
we
sought
for
my
young
master

Let
this
(
if
it
be
so
in
the
meantime
satisfy
you
that
none
is
much
better
than
an
unfit
one

And
if
I
knew
what
state
he
at
present
was
in
as
to
learning
I
might
perhaps
think
of
some
way
wherein
he
might
under
your
eye
improve
sufficiently
for
his
years
without
almost
any
trouble
to
you
and
so
the
principles
of
virtue
sense
and
breeding
which
are
the
main
business
be
preserved
and
nursed
up
in
the
way
you
have
begun
and
not
all
these
as
is
used
be
sacrificed
to
a
little
Latin
under
the
management
of
an
ill
or
imprudent
tutor
unskilled
as
it
often
happens
in
those
essential
points

Though
it
hath
hitherto
escaped
my
pen
yet
it
has
been
often
in
my
head
to
enquire
what
course
you
took
about
your
water
and
whether
you
are
supplied
from
the
spring
we
examined
when
I
was
there

I
have
had
many
projects
upon
that
affair
in
my
head
though
I
never
troubled
you
with
any
of
them
hoping
that
your
house
is
well
supplied
with
good
water
without
them

But
finding
that
other
people's
letters
were
refused
to
be
meddled
with
I
thought
it
good
manners
not
to
give
the
trouble
of
any
of
mine
so
that
the
two
Ladies
were
excused
one
from
carrying
and
the
other
from
reading
a
long
letter
from
me

But
pray
tell
her
she
has
no
great
loss
in
it

For
it
being
past
doubt
that
I
am
her
humble
servant
with
the
utmost
affection
and
respect
anybody
can
be
I
had
nothing
to
add
to
it
but
compliments
for
my
being
at
that
distance
which
permits
me
not
those
opportunities
of
performing
those
parts
of
duty
and
gratitude
belong
to
me
and
enjoying
sometimes
at
Chipley
the
company
I
most
desire
in
the
world

I
am
Sir
your
most
obliged
and
most
humble
servant
J.L

Pray
remember
me
to
young
master
and
my
little
pretty
Mistress

J.
I
take
it
something
amiss
that
you
have
said
nothing
particularly
of
her
to
me
this
long
time
but
I
am
glad
to
hear
from
another
hand
that
all
your
little
ones
thrive
bravely
for
so
I
am
told
in
a
letter
I
lately
received

The
news
you
may
believe
was
very
welcome
both
because
I
have
so
much
reason
to
love
father
and
mother
and
all
the
family
and
also
I
am
glad
to
find
that
my
plain
rustic
way
of
feeding
and
nursing
children
has
not
such
hardships
in
it
as
to
hurt
even
the
tender
sex

For
I
flatter
myself
that
Madam
in
breeding
her
daughters
has
inclined
a
little
to
my
method

Though
bateing
that
and
the
negligence
of
the
style
you
will
find
very
little
in
the
argument
itself
that
I
think
for
the
matter
of
it
needs
altering

Of
what
use
it
may
be
to
any
other
I
cannot
tell
but
if
I
flatter
not
myself
I
has
been
of
great
help
to
our
first
enquiry
and
the
search
of
knowledge
ever
since
has
been
in
my
thoughts
which
is
now
five
or
six
years

For
so
long
ago
is
it
since
some
friends
upon
an
accidental
discourse
started
me
upon
this
enquiry
which
I
am
not
sorry
for

And
if
it
has
cost
me
some
pains
in
thinking
it
has
rewarded
me
by
the
light
I
imagine
I
have
received
from
it
as
well
as
by
the
pleasure
of
discovering
certain
truths
which
to
me
at
least
were
new

for
being
resolved
to
examine
humane
understanding
and
the
ways
of
our
knowledge
not
by
others'
opinions
but
by
what
I
could
from
my
own
observations
collect
myself
I
have
purposely
avoided
the
reading
of
all
books
that
treated
any
way
of
the
subject
that
so
I
might
have
nothing
to
bias
me
any
way
but
might
leave
my
thought
free
to
entertain
only
what
the
matter
itself
suggested
to
my
meditations

So
that
if
they
at
any
time
jump
with
others
twas
not
that
I
followed
them
and
if
they
differ
'twas
not
out
of
contradiction
or
a
mind
to
be
singular

My
aim
has
been
only
truth
so
far
as
my
shortsightedness
could
reach
it
and
where
I
have
misstated
it
in
part
or
in
the
whole
I
shall
be
glad
to
be
set
right

Read
it
therefore
as
a
friend's
act
judge
of
it
as
a
stranger's
and
let
me
have
your
opinion
with
the
greatest
freedom
than
which
there
can
be
nothing
more
obliging
to
Your
most
humble
servant
J.L

DEAR
SIR
Since
my
last
I
have
gotten
the
abridgment
which
came
to
me
in
quires
bound
and
gilded
as
the
other
was
and
according
to
your
order
have
placed
it
in
Sir
walter's
hands
to
be
conveyed
to
mrs
duke

And
the
other
which
remains
in
marble
paper
I
shall
also
send
by
him
to
Mr.
freke
about
a
fortnight
hence
when
he
designs
to
go
out
of
town
if
I
have
no
other
opportunity
by
a
safe
hand
in
the
meantime
to
convey
it
to
him

I
have
also
gotten
you
a
good
beaver
hat
made
by
the
diameter
of
the
inside
of
the
crown
of
the
band
exactly
according
to
the
dimension
marked
by
the
two
black
pins
in
your
letter
of
the
ninth
instant

A
peruke
I
have
also
bought
for
you
pursuant
to
your
directions
in
the
same
letter
as
near
as
possible
as
I
could

And
these
together
with
six
flannel-shirts
(
bought
and
made
up
by
your
very
good
friend
Mrs.
R.S

and
a
cloak
which
in
the
buying
and
making
up
I
gave
her
my
best
assistance
I
have
sent
hence
by
your
old
friend
Adrian
who
stayed
but
one
day
in
town
and
is
this
day
set
out
from
hence
towards
you
and
it
is
possible
may
be
with
you
as
soon
(
or
before
this
can
come
to
your
hands

He
promised
me
to
take
particular
care
of
them
all
and
to
see
them
safely
delivered
to
you
which
I
hope
he
will
do
they
being
all
in
my
opinion
extremely
good
of
the
kind
and
I
believe
will
give
content
in
the
wearing

By
him
you
will
also
receive
a
letter
that
I
had
from
Mr.
Stringer
in
answer
to
what
by
your
order
I
writ
to
him
touching
your
picture
by
which
you
will
find
that
he
is
resolved
not
to
part
with
it

But
since
there
are
so
many
accidents
which
may
contradict
my
intentions
in
this
particular
I
dare
promise
nothing
but
trust
on
Providence
to
send
us
a
happy
meeting
which
I
earnestly
desire
and
long
for

In
the
meantime
give
me
leave
to
assure
you
that
I
will
use
all
imaginable
care
and
caution
to
find
out
the
truth
of
what
was
done
in
that
affair
touching
w
p
and
my
cousin
that
in
your
last
you
mentioned
to
me

And
I
will
also
take
care
to
get
’sop's
Fables
in
Latin
English
and
French
with
cuts
as
you
have
ordered
and
will
wait
your
further
directions
for
making
the
best
use
of
them

Just
now
I
received
the
enclosed
from
my
son
with
his
earnest
desires
that
in
my
next
it
might
be
conveyed
to
you

It
was
in
the
shape
of
a
letter
directed
to
you
but
the
back-part
of
it
for
the
conveniency
of
postage
I
took
off
and
hope
you
will
pardon
both
him
and
me
for
troubling
you
with
it
since
you
will
there
see
what
good
effects
the
following
of
your
methods
in
teaching
the
child
to
write
as
well
as
all
other
things
hath
already
produced

He
begins
to
be
sensible
of
the
great
kindness
you
have
done
him
and
I
hope
as
he
increases
in
knowledge
he
will
be
no
less
grateful
than
him
who
by
all
manner
of
ties
you
have
obliged
to
be
never
other
than
Your
most
affectionate
faithful
servant
E
Madam
gives
her
hearty
service
to
you
is
very
well
but
not
yet
laid
and
joins
her
desires
with
mine
that
you
will
send
prints
of
those
copies
of
which
you
have
already
given
us
a
sight
the
caracter
being
much
better
(
as
I
think
than
any
I
can
get
here
etc.

I
have
written
again
to
Mr.
Elwill
who
hath
repeated
his
promises
under
hand
to
me
that
he
will
take
particular
care
to
send
the
bags
again
to
Mr.
Furley
wherein
the
provision
for
the
sheep
was
sent
over
etc.

Addr

DEAR
SIR
Saturday
night
last
I
returned
hither
from
the
West
and
found
my
wife
and
children
well
here

I
was
with
your
cousin
Stratton
at
Sutton
Court
and
at
his
own
house
about
a
fortnight
since
but
could
not
be
so
serviceable
to
you
there
as
I
designed
by
reason
he
had
not
nor
could
not
possibly
(
as
he
said
make
out
your
accompt
for
me
but
promised
to
return
fifty
pounds
of
your
money
hither
to
me
with
the
first
opportunity
and
make
his
accounts
perfect
agianst
my
coming
again
into
that
country

There
are
generally
great
complaints
of
the
difficulties
to
raise
money
amongst
tenants
but
I
meet
with
none
greater
than
those
I
have
heard
from
Mr.
Stratton
the
tenants
thereabouts
being
much
worse
than
formerly
and
(
as
he
says
are
grown
so
poor
and
scarce
that
unless
they
are
permitted
to
have
their
rents
left
in
their
hands
for
a
considerable
time
and
other
advantages
besides
there
is
not
a
tenant
to
be
had
for
anything
in
these
parts

By
all
which
I
presume
there
are
some
arrears
greater
than
he
was
willing
to
tell
me
the
particulars
of
at
that
time
especially
having
a
prospect
that
the
greatest
part
of
them
will
be
speedily
gotten
in

Mr.
Stratton
hath
followed
the
method
I
directed
and
without
any
difficulty
and
trouble
hath
got
into
his
hands
your
lease
to
Robert
Haroll
of
the
home-close
at
Beluton
etc
which
will
be
a
further
security
for
what
remains
due
from
him
to
prevent
him
in
his
design
of
making
such
unreasonable
advantages
upon
you
as
he
intended
by
it

My
time
at
present
will
not
permit
me
to
give
you
a
more
particular
account
of
your
affairs
in
Somerset
but
if
I
can
be
so
happy
as
to
see
you
this
summer
as
I
intended
you
will
then
be
more
fully
informed
but
ever
since
I
fixed
my
thoughts
of
that
enjoyment
everything
has
seemed
to
conspire
against
me
in
it

First
many
cross
accidents
in
my
own
affairs
have
happened
besides
the
death
of
my
Lady
King
which
brought
me
into
a
trust
for
her
children

And
immediately
upon
that
the
sickness
and
death
of
my
Cousin
Clarke's
lady
here
he
being
at
that
time
extremely
ill
and
since
dead
in
the
country
leaving
the
care
of
his
estate
and
four
young
children
upon
me
hath
so
much
increased
my
affairs
and
troubles
that
at
present
I
can
hardly
see
a
way
through
them

is
just
now
come
in
with
your
letter
that
came
enclosed
the
last
week
to
her
for
me
and
gives
you
her
real
love
and
service
but
at
present
the
time
will
not
permit
me
to
answer
any
part
of
it

But
you
may
be
certain
I
will
carefully
perform
what
is
therein
desired
and
answer
it
with
the
first
opportunity
and
for
ever
remain
your
most
affectionate
friend
and
faithful
servant
E
Madam
gives
her
service
to
you
etc.

For
Mr.

These

London
15th
June
1688

Dear
Sir
Soon
after
the
writing
of
the
5th
instant
to
you
I
was
taken
ill
of
a
disease
that
of
late
has
been
almost
universal
in
the
town
which
fell
into
my
eyes
and
disabled
me
for
all
manner
of
business
for
a
considerable
time

But
I
can
now
inform
you
that
I
have
spoken
with
Mr.
Oakley
who
tells
me
that
he
pursued
Adrian's
orders
with
a
blind
obedience
in
that
affair
relating
to
R.B

and
by
letter
hath
given
you
a
particular
account
thereof

As
to
your
affair
with
Mr.
Stringer
touching
your
picture
I
have
seriously
considered
all
parts
of
it
and
without
partiality
do
assure
you
that
I
cannot
find
anything
blameable
in
any
of
your
proceedings
therein
and
therefore
as
opportunity
serves
I
will
use
my
utmost
skill
and
interest
to
make
Mr.
Stringer
sensible
thereof
and
put
an
end
to
the
contest
if
it
be
to
be
done

And
what
further
I
may
be
sensible
to
you
in
shall
at
all
times
be
faithfully
and
willingly
performed
by
Your
most
affectionate
humble
servant
E
Your
old
friend
Nath.
Hodges
will
be
in
town
the
latter
end
of
this
week
and
he
shall
have
the
only
remaining
abrégé‚
delivered
to
him
as
you
desire
etc.

Mr.
Cheswell
hath
paid
all
home
to
Christmas
last
etc.

Madam
and
the
young
fry
are
well
and
give
you
their
best
service
etc.

Addr

For
Mr.
John
Locke
These

Dear
Sir
Your
kind
letter
of
the
17th
has
been
now
a
full
week
in
my
hands
for
which
you
had
immediately
received
my
thanks
had
I
been
able
to
write

But
soon
after
my
last
of
the
16th
from
Salisbury
to
you
I
was
taken
ill
of
an
ague
with
an
ill
fever
that
attended
it
which
so
much
weakened
me
that
it
was
not
without
great
difficulty
I
got
hither
but
by
use
of
the
Cortex
Peruv

The
lime
tree
seeds
and
the
turnip
seeds
you
mention
will
be
no
less
acceptable
when
they
come
but
I
hear
nothing
as
yet
of
their
arrival

I
am
entirely
satisfied
in
every
article
of
yours
and
Mr.
F.'s
accompts
and
do
not
doubt
but
Mr.
Percival
will
make
punctual
payment
of
the
bill
that
is
drawn
on
him
for
110
17
s
11
d.
mentioned
in
your
letter

But
I
have
neither
strength
nor
time
to
thank
my
good
friend
Benjamin
Furly
as
I
ought
either
for
his
great
kindness
to
me
whilst
I
was
in
Holland
or
the
extraordinary
care
and
trouble
he
hath
taken
for
me
since

And
therefore
I
beg
you
to
make
him
sensible
of
my
hearty
acknowledgments
and
earnest
hopes
that
I
may
some
time
or
other
be
happy
in
an
opportunity
to
serve
him

And
I
heartily
thank
you
for
opening
the
complimentary
letter
you
mention
that
was
directed
to
me

And
I
wish
you
had
done
the
like
by
the
other
also
for
I
cannot
guess
at
the
hand
by
that
part
of
the
superscription
you
sent
me

Therfore
pray
open
that
also
and
in
your
next
let
me
know
the
contents
of
it
if
material
and
by
whom
it
was
written

And
with

DEAR
NEPHEW
-
I
give
you
many
thanks
for
your
kinde
letter
and
the
sense
you
have
of
my
affliction
which
is
truly
very
great

But
since
it
is
laid
upon
me
by
the
hands
of
an
Almighty
and
gracious
God
that
always
proportions
His
punishments
to
the
support
He
gives
with
them
I
may
hope
to
bear
it
as
a
Christian
ought
to
doe
and
more
especially
one
that
is
conscious
to
herself
of
having
in
many
ways
deserved
it

The
strong
revolutions
we
have
seen
might
well
have
taught
mee
what
this
world
is
yett
it
seems
it
was
necessary
that
I
should
have
a
nearer
example
of
the
uncertainty
of
all
human
blessings
that
soe
having
noe
tye
to
the
world
I
may
the
better
prepare
myself
to
leave
it
and
that
this
correction
may
suffice
to
teach
me
my
duty
is
the
prayer
of-Your
most
affectionate
aunt
and
humble
servant

We
are
got
hither
at
last
and
Papa
I
thank
God
very
well
and
so
insufferably
pert
with
winning
12
guineas
at
Crimp
last
night

When
she
is
there
pray
enquire
a
great
deal
of
our
East
India
ships
with
wh.
she
is
concerned
as
well
as
I
and
nobodye
can
inform
you
better
of
what
I
most
desire
to
know
is
whether
I
may
take
part
of
my
share
in
what
I
like
or
must
be
obliged
to
have
it
all
in
money
if
tis
divided
wch
wether
it
be
much
or
little
to
me
would
make
a
great
difference

And
now
I
must
tell
you
what
misfortunes
have
hear
befalled
some
of
your
friends
and
mine

My
Ld.
Portland
and
Monsr.
Overkerke
I
hear
have
had
a
quarrell
at
Loo
and
the
last
they
say
treated
him
like
a
dog
which
I
am
apt
enough
to
believe
for
people
are
too
apt
to
insult
when
one
is
falling
and
when
nobody
will
helpe
to
right
one

I
believe
one
has
seldom
the
heart
to
do
anything
towards
itt
themselves
this
they
say
has
extremely
exalted
another
person
and
altogether
tis
thought
more
than
my
Ld.
Portland
can
beare
altogether
any
longer
that
he
may
not
want
a
companion
in
his
afternoons
I
heare
that
Mrs.
Howard
came
t'other
day
from
where
Mrs.
Billingsly
had
order
to
take
ye
care
the
children
from
her
and
when
she
came
to
my
Lord
of
Essex'
lodgings
at
London
she
found
a
padlock

Upon
that
she
could
not
get
in
wch
Mr.
Billingsly
said
he
had
my
Lord
Essex's
order
for

You
know
whether
I
am
rightly
informed
in
all
this
and
pray
send
a
yd
of
muslin
for
pinners
and
ten
yards
of
crowsfoot
to
edge
it
with
to
Mrs.
Hanbury
before
you
leave
towne
the
Dke.
and
Dchess.
of
Richmond
dine
here
to-day
and
soe
my
newes
and
my
letter
are
at
an
end
together

Adieu
I
desire
you
will
send
word
to
East
Sheene
what
is
become
of
it
there
is
now
noe
doubt
of
our
being
home
to
receive
our
letters
on
Friday

You
never
told
me
what
became
of
Friday
Night

If
my
Father
cannot
prevail
with
you
to
remove
from
that
dismal
place
I
will
certainly
see
you
there
the
beginning
of
next
week
in
the
mean
time
all
you
desired
shall
be
speedily
done

And
I
can't
end
without
making
it
my
request
that
you
should
for
my
sake
take
some
care
of
yourselfe
and
let
not
y=r=
trouble
overcome
you
which
I
am
afraid
it
will
do
if
you
don't
strive
against
it

I
beg
to
have
my
humble
duty
presented
to
my
Father
whose
affliction
I
am
most
heartily
concerned
for

I
would
myselfe
have
writt
to
him
but
that
two
such
letters
are
not
to
be
writt
I
mightily
desire
that
I
may
hear
how
you
and
your
Father
do
and
dear
(
Ant
remember
yourselfe
in
thinking
how
many
kind
friends
you
have
left
which
I
am
sure
deserve
your
care
and
some
return
for
there
concern
for
you

I
wish
I
had
gone
down
now
with
my
Father
but
next
week
if
it
please
God
somewhere
I
will
see
you
till
when
I
shall
not
be
easy

Adieu

The
only
reason
that
kept
mee
from
writing
to
you
Deare
Madam
was
the
fear
I
had
of
troubling
you
but
I
cannot
forbeare
any
longer
from
telling
you
how
sure
a
sense
I
have
of
your
misfortune
I
shall
allways
be
most
heartily
sory
for
any
thing
that
afflicts
you
but
in
this
I
thinke
myselfe
particularly
concerned
for
both
my
Lord
and
I
have
lost
a
friend
wee
had
a
very
reall
esteem
and
kindnesse
for
and
shall
ever
have
soe
for
his
memory
I
will
say
noe
more
on
soe
sad
a
subject
but
end
this
with
begging
you
to
believe
that
noe
body
liveing
is
mor
sincerely
your
faithfull
Humble
servant
